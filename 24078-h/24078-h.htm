<h3 style="padding-top: 3em;">CHAPTER I.</h3>

<h3>SOSTH&Egrave;NE.</h3>


<p>Bayou Teche is the dividing line. On its left is
the land of bayous, lakes, and swamps; on its right, the
beautiful short-turfed prairies of Western Louisiana.
The Vermilion River divides the vast prairie into the
countries of Attakapas on the east and Opelousas on
the west. On its west bank, at its head of navigation,
lies the sorry little town of Vermilionville, near about
which on the north and east the prairie rises and falls
with a gentle swell, from whose crests one may, as
from the top of a wave, somewhat overlook the surrounding
regions.</p>

<p>Until a few years ago, stand on whichever one you
might, the prospect stretched away, fair and distant,
in broad level or gently undulating expanses of crisp,
compact turf, dotted at remote intervals by farms, each
with its low-roofed house nestled in a planted grove of
oaks, or, oftener, Pride of China trees. Far and near
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
herds of horses and cattle roamed at will over the plain.
If for a moment, as you passed from one point of view
to another, the eye was shut in, it was only where in
some lane you were walled in by fields of dense tall
sugar-cane or cotton, or by huge green Chickasaw
hedges, studded with their white-petalled, golden-centred
roses. Eastward the plain broke into slight
ridges, which, by comparison with the general level,
were called hills; while toward the north it spread
away in quieter swells, with more frequent fields and
larger houses.</p>

<p>North, south, east, and west, far beyond the circle
of these horizons, not this parish of Lafayette only,
but St. Landry, St. Martin, Iberia, St. Mary&rsquo;s, Vermilion,&mdash;all
are the land of the Acadians. This
quarter off here to northward was named by the Nova-Scotian
exiles, in memory of the land from which they
were driven, the Beau Bassin. These small homestead
groves that dot the plain far and wide are the homes
of their children. Here is this one on a smooth green
billow of the land, just without the town. It is not like
the rest,&mdash;a large brick house, its Greek porch half
hid in a grove of oaks. On that dreadful day, more
than a century ago, when the British in far-off Acadie
shut into the chapel the villagers of Grand Pr&eacute;, a certain
widow fled with her children to the woods, and
there subsisted for ten days on roots and berries, until
finally, the standing crops as well as the houses being
destroyed, she was compelled to accept exile, and in
time found her way, with others, to these prairies.
Her son founded Vermilionville. Her grandson rose
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
to power,&mdash;sat in the Senate of the United States.
From early manhood to hale gray age, the people of
his State were pleased to hold him, now in one capacity,
now in another, in their honored service; they made
him Senator, Governor, President of Convention, what
you will. I have seen the portrait for which he sat
in early manhood to a noted English court painter:
dark waving locks; strong, well-chiselled features; fine
clear eyes; an air of warm, steady-glowing intellectual
energy. It hangs still in the home of which I speak.
And I have seen an old ambrotype of him, taken in
the days of this story: hair short-cropped, gray; eyes
thoughtful, courageous; mouth firm, kind, and ready
to smile.</p>

<p>It must have been some years before this picture
was taken, that, as he issued from his stately porch,&mdash;which
the oaks, young then, did not hide from view
as they do now,&mdash;coming forth to mount for his regular
morning ride, a weary-faced woman stood before
him, holding by the hand a little toddling boy. She
was sick; the child was hungry. He listened to her
tale. Their conversation was in French.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Widow, are you? And your husband was a
Frenchman: yes, I see. Are you an Acadian? You
haven&rsquo;t the accent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am a Creole,&rdquo; she said, with a perceptible flush
of resentment. So that he responded amiably:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and, like all Creoles, proud of it, as you are
right to be. But I am an Acadian of the Acadians,
and never wished I was any thing else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He found her a haven a good half-day&rsquo;s ride out
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
across the prairies north-westward, in the home of his
long-time acquaintance, Sosth&egrave;ne Gradnego, who had
no more heart than his wife had to say No to either
their eminent friend or a houseless widow; and, as to
children, had so many already, that one more was
nothing. They did not feel the burden of her, she
died so soon; but they soon found she had left with
them a positive quantity in her little prattling, restless,
high-tempered Bonaventure. Bonaventure Deschamps:
he was just two years younger than their own little
Zos&eacute;phine.</p>

<p>Sosth&egrave;ne was already a man of some note in this
region,&mdash;a region named after a bird. Why would it
not often be well so to name places,&mdash;for the bird that
most frequents the surrounding woods or fields? How
pleasant to have one&rsquo;s hamlet called Nightingale, or
Whippoorwill, or Goldfinch, or Oriole! The home
of Zos&eacute;phine and Bonaventure&rsquo;s childhood was in the
district known as Carancro; in bluff English, Carrion
Crow.</p>

<h3>BONAVENTURE AND ZOS&Eacute;PHINE.</h3>


<p>They did not live <i>&agrave; la chapelle</i>; that is, in the village
of six or eight houses clustered about the small
wooden spire and cross of the mission chapel. Sosth&egrave;ne&rsquo;s
small ground-story cottage, with garret stairs
outside in front on the veranda and its five-acre farm
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
behind, was not even on a highway nor on the edge
of any rich <i>bas fond</i>,&mdash;creek-bottom. It was <i>au large</i>,&mdash;far
out across the smooth, unscarred turf of the
immense prairie, conveniently near one of the clear
circular ponds&mdash;<i>maraises</i>&mdash;which one sees of every
size and in every direction on the seemingly level land.
Here it sat, as still as a picture, within its hollow
square of China-trees, which every third year yielded
their limbs for fuel; as easy to overlook the first time&mdash;as
easy to see the next time&mdash;as a bird sitting on
her eggs. Only the practised eye could read aright
the infrequent obscure signs of previous travel that
showed the way to it,&mdash;sometimes no more than the
occasional soilure of the short turf by a few wheels or
hoofs where the route led into or across the <i>cool&eacute;es</i>&mdash;rivulets&mdash;that
from <i>marais</i> to <i>marais</i> slipped southward
toward the great marshes of the distant, unseen
Gulf.</p>

<p>When I say the parent of one of these two children
and guardian of the other was a man of note, I mean,
for one thing, his house was painted. That he was
the owner of thousands of cattle, one need not mention,
for so were others who were quite inconspicuous,
living in unpainted houses, rarely seeing milk, never
tasting butter; men who at call of their baptismal
names would come forth from these houses barefooted
and bareheaded in any weather, and, while their
numerous progeny grouped themselves in the doorway
one behind another in inverse order of age and stature,
would either point out your lost way, or, quite as
readily as Sosth&egrave;ne, ask you in beneath a roof where
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
the coffee-pot never went dry or grew cold by day.
Nor would it distinguish him from them to say he had
many horses or was always well mounted. It was a
land of horsemen. One met them incessantly; men
in broad hats and dull homespun, with thin, soft,
untrimmed brown beards, astride of small but handsome
animals, in Mexican saddles, the girths and
bridles of plaited hair, sometimes a <i>pialle</i> or <i>arriatte</i>&mdash;lasso,
lariat&mdash;of plaited rawhide coiled at the saddle-bow.
&ldquo;Adieu, Onesime&rdquo;&mdash;always adieu at meeting,
the same as at parting. &ldquo;Adieu, Fran&ccedil;ois; adieu,
Christophe; adieu, Lazare;&rdquo; and they with their
gentle, brown-eyed, wild-animal gaze, &ldquo;Adjieu.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What did make Sosth&egrave;ne notable was the quiet thing
we call thrift, made graceful by certain rudiments of
taste. To say Sosth&egrave;ne, means Madame Sosth&egrave;ne as
well; and this is how it was that Zos&eacute;phine Gradnego
and Bonaventure Deschamps, though they went not
to school, nevertheless had &ldquo;advantages.&rdquo; For instance,
the clean, hard-scrubbed cypress floors beneath
their pattering feet; the neat round parti-colored mats
at the doors that served them for towns and villages;
the strips of home-woven carpet that stood for roads&mdash;this
one to Mermentau, that one to C&ocirc;te Gel&eacute;e, a
third <i>&agrave; la chapelle</i>; the walls of unpainted pine; the
beaded joists under the ceiling; the home-made furniture,
bedsteads and wardrobes of stained woods, and
hickory chairs with rawhide seats, hair uppermost;
the white fringed counterpanes on the high featherbeds;
especially, in the principal room, the house&rsquo;s
one mantelpiece, of wood showily stained in three
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
colors and surmounted by a pair of gorgeous vases,
beneath which the two children used to stand and feast
their eyes, worth fifty cents if they were worth one,&mdash;these
were as books to them indoors; and out in the
tiny garden, where they played wild horse and wild
cow, and lay in ambush for butterflies, they came under
the spell of marigolds, prince&rsquo;s-feathers, lady-slippers,
immortelles, portulaca, jonquil, lavender, alth&aelig;a, love-apples,
sage, violets, amaryllis, and that grass ribbon
they call <i>jarreti&egrave;re de la vierge</i>,&mdash;the virgin&rsquo;s garter.</p>

<p>Time passed; the children grew. The children older
than they in the same house became less and less like
children, and began to disappear from the family board
and roof by a mysterious process called marrying,
which greatly mystified Zos&eacute;phine, but equally pleased
her by the festive and jocund character of the occasions,
times when there was a ravishing abundance of
fried rice-cakes and <i>boulettes</i>&mdash;beef-balls.</p>

<p>To Bonaventure these affairs brought less mystery
and less unalloyed pleasure. He understood them
better. Some boys are born lovers. From the time
they can reach out from the nurse&rsquo;s arms, they must
be billing and cooing and choosing a mate. Such was
ardent little Bonaventure; and none of the Gradnego
weddings ever got quite through its ceremony without
his big blue eyes being found full of tears&mdash;tears
of mingled anger and desolation&mdash;because by some
unpardonable oversight he and Zos&eacute;phine were still
left unmarried. So that the pretty damsel would
have to take him aside, and kiss him as they clasped,
and promise him, &ldquo;Next time&mdash;next time, without
fail!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
Nevertheless, he always reaped two proud delights
from these events. For one, Sosth&egrave;ne always took
him upon his lap and introduced him as his little
Creole. And the other, the ex-governor came to these
demonstrations&mdash;the great governor! who lifted him
to his knee and told him of those wonderful things
called cities, full of people that could read and write;
and about steamboats and steam-cars.</p>

<p>At length one day, when weddings had now pretty
well thinned out the ranks of Sosth&egrave;ne&rsquo;s family, the
ex-governor made his appearance though no marriage
was impending. Bonaventure, sitting on his knee,
asked why he had come, and the ex-governor told
him there was war.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you not want to make haste and grow up and
be a dragoon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The child was silent, and Sosth&egrave;ne laughed a little
as he said privately in English, which tongue his
exceptional thrift had put him in possession of:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aw, naw!&rdquo;&mdash;he shook his head amusedly&mdash;&ldquo;he
dawn&rsquo;t like hoss. Go to put him on hoss, he
kick like a frog. Yass; squeal wuss&rsquo;n a pig. But
still, sem time, you know, he ain&rsquo;t no coward; git
mad in minute; fight like little ole ram. Dawn&rsquo;t
ondstand dat little fellah; he love flower&rsquo; like he was
a gal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He ought to go to school,&rdquo; said the ex-governor.
And Sosth&egrave;ne, half to himself, responded in a hopeless
tone:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yass.&rdquo; Neither Sosth&egrave;ne nor any of his children
had ever done that.</p>

<h3><a name="PART_I_CHAP_III" id="PART_I_CHAP_III"></a>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<h3>ATHANASIUS.</h3>


<p>War it was. The horsemen grew scarce on the
wide prairies of Opelousas. Far away in Virginia,
Tennessee, Georgia, on bloody fields, many an Acadian
volunteer and many a poor conscript fought and
fell for a cause that was really none of theirs, simple,
non-slaveholding peasants; and many died in camp
and hospital&mdash;often of wounds, often of fevers, often
of mere longing for home. Bonaventure and Zos&eacute;phine
learned this much of war: that it was a state
of affairs in which dear faces went away, and strange
ones came back with tidings that brought bitter wailings
from mothers and wives, and made <i>les vieux</i>&mdash;the
old fathers&mdash;sit very silent. Three times over
that was the way of it in Sosth&egrave;ne&rsquo;s house.</p>

<p>It was also a condition of things that somehow
changed boys into men very young. A great distance
away, but still in sight south-westward across the
prairie, a dot of dark green showed where dwelt a
sister and brother-in-law of Sosth&egrave;ne&rsquo;s <i>vieille</i>,&mdash;wife.
There was not the same domestic excellence there as
at Sosth&egrave;ne&rsquo;s; yet the dooryard was very populous
with fowls; within the house was always heard the
hard thump, thump, of the loom, or the loud moan of
the spinning-wheel; and the children were many. The
eldest was Athanase. Though but fifteen he was
already stalwart, and showed that intelligent
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
sympathy in the family cares that makes such offspring the
mother&rsquo;s comfort and the father&rsquo;s hope. At that age
he had done but one thing to diminish that comfort or
that hope. One would have supposed an ambitious
chap like him would have spent his first earnings, as
other ambitious ones did, for a saddle; but &rsquo;Thanase
Beausoleil had bought a fiddle.</p>

<p>He had hardly got it before he knew how to play it.
Yet, to the father&rsquo;s most welcome surprise, he remained
just as bold a rider and as skilful a thrower of the
<i>arriatte</i> as ever. He came into great demand for
the Saturday-night balls. When the courier with a
red kerchief on a wand came galloping round, the day
before, from <i>&icirc;le</i> to <i>&icirc;le</i>,&mdash;for these descendants of a
maritime race call their homestead groves islands,&mdash;to
tell where the ball was to be, he would assert, if
there was even a hope of it, that &rsquo;Thanase was to be
the fiddler.</p>

<p>In this way &rsquo;Thanase and his pretty little <i>jarmaine</i>&mdash;first
cousin&mdash;Zos&eacute;phine, now in her fourteenth
year, grew to be well acquainted. For at thirteen,
of course, she began to move in society, which meant
to join in the contra-dance. &rsquo;Thanase did not dance
with her, or with any one. She wondered why he did
not; but many other girls had similar thoughts about
themselves. He only played, his playing growing
better and better, finer and finer, every time he was
heard anew. As to the few other cavaliers, very willing
were they to have it so. The music could not be
too good, and if &rsquo;Thanase was already perceptibly a
rival when hoisted up in a chair on top of a table,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
fiddle and bow in hand, &ldquo;twisting,&rdquo; to borrow their
own phrase&mdash;&ldquo;twisting the ears of that little red
beast and rubbing his abdomen with a stick,&rdquo; it was
just as well not to urge him to come down into the
lists upon the dancing-floor. But they found one
night, at length, that the music could be too good&mdash;when
&rsquo;Thanase struck up something that was not a
dance, and lads and damsels crowded around standing
and listening and asking ever for more, and the ball
turned out a failure because the concert was such a
success.</p>

<p>The memory of that night was of course still vivid
next day, Sunday, and Zos&eacute;phine&rsquo;s memory was as
good as any one&rsquo;s. I wish you might have seen her
in those days of the early bud. The time had returned
when Sosth&egrave;ne could once more get all his household&mdash;so
had marriages decimated it&mdash;into one vehicle,
a thing he had not been able to do for almost these
twenty years. Zos&eacute;phine and Bonaventure sat on a
back seat contrived for them in the family cal&egrave;che.
In front were the broad-brimmed Campeachy hat of
Sosth&egrave;ne and the meek, limp sunbonnet of <i>la vieille</i>.
About the small figure of the daughter there was
always something distinguishing, even if you rode up
from behind, that told of youth, of mettle, of self-regard;
a neatness of fit in the dress, a firm erectness
in the little slim back, a faint proudness of neck, a
glimpse of ribbon at the throat, another at the waist;
a something of assertion in the slight crispness of her
homespun sunbonnet, and a ravishing glint of two
sparks inside it as you got one glance within&mdash;no more.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
And as you rode on, if you were a young blade, you
would be&mdash;as the soldier lads used to say&mdash;all
curled up; but if you were an old mustache, you
would smile inwardly and say to yourself, &ldquo;She will
have her way; she will make all winds blow in her
chosen direction; she will please herself; she will be
her own good luck and her own commander-in-chief,
and, withal, nobody&rsquo;s misery or humiliation, unless
you count the swain after swain that will sigh in
vain.&rdquo; As for Bonaventure, sitting beside her, you
could just see his bare feet limply pendulous under
his wide palm-leaf hat. And yet he was a very real
personage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bonaventure,&rdquo; said Zos&eacute;phine,&mdash;this was as they
were returning from church, the wide rawhide straps
of their huge wooden two-wheeled vehicle creaking as
a new saddle would if a new saddle were as big as a
house,&mdash;&ldquo;Bonaventure, I wish you could learn how
to dance. I am tired trying to teach you.&rdquo; (This
and most of the unbroken English of this story stands
for Acadian French.)</p>

<p>Bonaventure looked meek for a moment, and then
resentful as he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Thanase does not dance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Thanase! Bah! What has &rsquo;Thanase to do with
it? Who was even thinking of &rsquo;Thanase? Was he
there last night? Ah yes! I just remember now
he was. But even he could dance if he chose; while
you&mdash;you can&rsquo;t learn! You vex me. &rsquo;Thanase!
What do you always bring him up for? I wish you
would have the kindness just not to remind me of him!
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
Why does not some one tell him how he looks, hoisted
up with his feet in our faces, scratching his fiddle?
Now, the fiddle, Bonaventure&mdash;the fiddle would just
suit you. Ah, if you could play!&rdquo; But the boy&rsquo;s
quick anger so flashed from his blue eyes that she
checked herself and with contemplative serenity added:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pity nobody else can play so well as that tiresome
fellow. It was positively silly, the way some girls
stood listening to him last night. I&rsquo;d be ashamed, or,
rather, too proud, to flatter such a high-headed care-for-nobody.
I wish he wasn&rsquo;t my cousin!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bonaventure, still incensed, remarked with quiet intensity
that he knew why she wished &rsquo;Thanase was
not a cousin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no such a thing!&rdquo; exclaimed Zos&eacute;phine so
forcibly that Madame Sosth&egrave;ne&rsquo;s sunbonnet turned
around, and a murmur of admonition came from it.
But the maiden was smiling and saying blithely to
Bonaventure:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&mdash;you can&rsquo;t even guess well.&rdquo; She was
about to say more, but suddenly hushed. Behind them
a galloping horse drew near, softly pattering along the
turfy road. As he came abreast, he dropped into a
quiet trot.</p>

<p>The rider was a boyish yet manly figure in a new
suit of gray home-made linsey, the pantaloons thrust
into the tops of his sturdy russet boots, and the jacket
ending underneath a broad leather belt that carried a
heavy revolver in its holster at one hip. A Campeachy
hat shaded his face and shoulders, and a pair of Mexican
spurs tinkled their little steel bells against their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
huge five-spiked rowels on his heels. He scarcely sat
in the saddle-tree&mdash;from hat to spurs you might have
drawn a perpendicular line. It would have taken in
shoulders, thighs, and all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Adjieu,&rdquo; said the young centaur; and Sosth&egrave;ne
replied from the creaking cal&egrave;che, &ldquo;Adjieu, &rsquo;Thanase,&rdquo;
while the rider bestowed his rustic smile upon the group.
Madame Sosth&egrave;ne&rsquo;s eyes met his, and her lips moved
in an inaudible greeting; but the eyes of her little
daughter were in her lap. Bonaventure&rsquo;s gaze was
hostile. A word or two passed between uncle and
nephew, including a remark and admission that the
cattle-thieves were getting worse than ever; and with
a touch of the spur, the young horseman galloped on.</p>

<p>It seems enough to admit that Zos&eacute;phine&rsquo;s further
remarks were silly without reporting them in full.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look at his back! What airs! If I had looked
up I should have laughed in his face!&rdquo; etc. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo;
she concluded, after much such chirruping, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s
one comfort&mdash;he doesn&rsquo;t care a cent for me. If I
should die to-morrow, he would forget to come to the
funeral. And you think I wouldn&rsquo;t be glad? Well,
you&rsquo;re mistaken, as usual. I hate him, and I just
know he hates me! Everybody hates me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The eyes of her worshipper turned upon her. But
she only turned her own away across the great plain
to the vast arching sky, and patted the cal&egrave;che with a
little foot that ached for deliverance from its Sunday
shoe. Then her glance returned, and all the rest of
the way home she was as sweet as the last dip of cane-juice
from the boiling battery.</p>

<h3><a name="PART_I_CHAP_IV" id="PART_I_CHAP_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<h3>THE CONSCRIPT OFFICER.</h3>


<p>By and by &rsquo;Thanase was sixteen. Eighteen was
the lowest age for conscription, yet he was in the Confederate
uniform. But then so was his uncle Sosth&egrave;ne;
so was his father. It signified merely that he had
been received into the home guard. The times were
sadly unsettled. Every horseman, and how much more
every group of horsemen, that one saw coming across
the prairie, was watched by anxious eyes, from the
moment they were visible specks, to see whether the
uniform would turn out to be the blue or the gray.
Which was the more unwelcome I shall not say, but
this I can, that the blue meant invasion and the gray
meant conscription. Sosth&egrave;ne was just beyond the
limit of age, and &rsquo;Thanase two years below it; but
&rsquo;Thanase&rsquo;s father kept a horse saddled all the time,
and slept indoors only on stormy nights.</p>

<p>Do not be misled: he was neither deserter nor coward;
else the nickname which had quite blotted out his
real name would not have been Chaouache&mdash;savage,
Indian. He was needed at home, and&mdash;it was not
his war. His war was against cattle-thieves and like
marauders, and there was no other man in all Carancro
whom these would not have had on their track rather
than him. But one gray dawn they found there was
another not unlike him. They had made an attempt
upon Sosth&egrave;ne&rsquo;s cattle one night; had found
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
themselves watched and discovered; had turned and fled
westward half the night, and had then camped in the
damp woods of a <i>bas fond</i>; when, just as day was
breaking and they were looking to their saddles about
to mount&mdash;there were seven of them&mdash;just then&mdash;listen!&mdash;a
sound of hoofs!</p>

<p>Instantly every left foot is in stirrup; but before
they can swing into the saddle a joyous cry is in their
ears, and pop! pop! pop! pop! ring the revolvers as,
with the glad, fierce cry still resounding, three horsemen
launch in upon them&mdash;only three, but those three
a whirlwind. See that riderless horse, and this one,
and that one! And now for it&mdash;three honest men
against four remaining thieves! Pop! pop! dodge,
and fire as you dodge! Pop! pop! pop! down he
goes; well done, gray-bearded Sosth&egrave;ne! Shoot
there! Wheel here! Wounded? Never mind&mdash;<i>ora!</i>
Another rogue reels! Collar him, Chaouache! drag
him from the saddle&mdash;down he goes! What, again?
Shoot there! Look out, that fellow&rsquo;s getting away!
Ah! down goes Sosth&egrave;ne&rsquo;s horse, breaking his strong
neck in the tumble. Up, bleeding old man&mdash;bang!
bang! Ha, ha, <i>ora!</i> that finishes&mdash;<i>ora!</i> &rsquo;Twas the
boy saved your life with that last shot, Sosth&egrave;ne, and
the boy&mdash;the youth is &rsquo;Thanase.</p>

<p>He has not stopped to talk; he and his father are
catching the horses of the dead and dying jayhawkers.
Now bind up Sosth&egrave;ne&rsquo;s head, and now &rsquo;Thanase&rsquo;s
hip. Now strip the dead beasts, and take the dead
men&rsquo;s weapons, boots, and spurs. Lift this one moaning
villain into his saddle and take him along, though
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
he is going to die before ten miles are gone over. So
they turn homeward, leaving high revel for the carrion-crows.</p>

<p>Think of Bonaventure, the slender, the intense, the
reticent&mdash;with &rsquo;Thanase limping on rude but glorious
crutches for four consecutive Saturdays and Sundays
up and down in full sight of Zos&eacute;phine, savior of her
mother from widowhood, owner of two fine captured
horses, and rewarded by Sosth&egrave;ne with five acres of
virgin prairie. If the young fiddler&rsquo;s music was an
attraction before, fancy its power now, when the
musician had to be lifted to his chair on top of the
table!</p>

<p>Bonaventure sought comfort of Zos&eacute;phine, and she
gave it, tittering at &rsquo;Thanase behind his back, giving
Bonaventure knowing looks, and sticking her sunbonnet
in her mouth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, if the bullet had only gone into the dandy&rsquo;s
fiddle-bow arm!&rdquo; she whispered gleefully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish he might never get well!&rdquo; said the boy.</p>

<p>The girl&rsquo;s smile vanished; her eyes flashed lightning
for an instant; the blood flew to her cheeks, and she
bit her lip.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you, now while he cannot help himself&mdash;why
don&rsquo;t you go to him and hit him square in
the face, like&rdquo;&mdash;her arm flew up, and she smote him
with her sunbonnet full between the eyes&mdash;&ldquo;like
that!&rdquo; She ran away, laughing joyously, while Bonaventure
sat down and wept with rage and shame.</p>

<p>Day by day he went about his trivial tasks and
efforts at pastime with the one great longing that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
Zos&eacute;phine would more kindly let him be her slave,
and something&mdash;any thing&mdash;take &rsquo;Thanase beyond
reach.</p>

<p>Instead of this &rsquo;Thanase got well, and began to
have a perceptible down on his cheek and upper lip,
to the great amusement of Zos&eacute;phine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He had better take care,&rdquo; she said one day to
Bonaventure, her eyes leaving their mirth and expanding
with sudden seriousness, &ldquo;or the conscript officer
will be after him, though he is but sixteen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Unlucky word! Bonaventure&rsquo;s bruised spirit seized
upon the thought. They were on their way even then
<i>&agrave; la chapelle</i>; and when they got there he knelt before
Mary&rsquo;s shrine and offered the longest and most earnest
prayer, thus far, of his life, and rose to his feet under
a burden of guilt he had never known before.</p>

<p>It was November. The next day the wind came
hurtling over the plains out of the north-west, bitter
cold. The sky was all one dark gray. At evening it
was raining. Sosth&egrave;ne said, as he sat down to supper,
that it was going to pour and blow all night. Chaouache
said much the same thing to his wife as they lay down
to rest. Farther away from Carancro than many of
Carancro&rsquo;s people had ever wandered, in the fire-lighted
public room of a village tavern, twelve or
fifteen men were tramping busily about, in muddy
boots and big clanking spurs, looking to pistols and
carbines of miscellaneous patterns, and securing them
against weather under their as yet only damp and
slightly bespattered great-coats, no two of which were
alike. They spoke to each other sometimes in French,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
sometimes in English that betrayed a Creole rather
than an Acadian accent. A young man with a neat
<i>kepi</i> tipped on one side of his handsome head stood
with his back to the fire, a sabre dangling to the floor
from beneath a captured Federal overcoat. A larger
man was telling him a good story. He listened smilingly,
dropped the remnant of an exhausted cigarette
to the floor, put his small, neatly booted foot upon it,
drew from his bosom one of those silken tobacco-bags
that our sisters in war-time used to make for all the
soldier boys, made a new cigarette, lighted it with the
flint and tinder for which the Creole smokers have such
a predilection, and put away his appliances, still hearkening
to the story. He nodded his head in hearty
approval as the tale was finished. It was the story of
Sosth&egrave;ne, Chaouache, &rsquo;Thanase, and the jayhawkers.
He gathered up his sabre and walked out, followed by
the rest. A rattle of saddles, a splashing of hoofs,
and then no sound was heard but the wind and the
pouring rain. The short column went out of the village
at full gallop.</p>

<p>Day was fully come when Chaouache rose and
stepped out upon his gal&eacute;rie. He had thought he
could venture to sleep in bed such a night; and, sure
enough, here morning came, and there had been no
intrusion. &rsquo;Thanase, too, was up. It was raining
and blowing still. Across the prairie, as far as the
eye could reach, not a movement of human life could
be seen. They went in again, made a fire of a few
fagots and an armful of cotton-seed, hung the kettle,
and emptied the old coffee from the coffee-pot.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
The mother and children rose and dressed. The
whole family huddled around the good, hot, cotton-seed
fire. No one looked out of window or door; in
such wind and rain, where was the need? In the little
log stable hard by, the two favorite saddle-horses
remained unsaddled and unbridled. The father&rsquo;s and
son&rsquo;s pistol-belts, with revolvers buttoned in their holsters,
hung on the bedposts by the headboards of their
beds. A long sporting rifle leaned in a corner near
the chimney.</p>

<p>Chaouache and &rsquo;Thanase got very busy plaiting a
horse-hair halter, and let time go by faster than they
knew. Madame Chaouache, so to call her, prepared
breakfast. The children played with the dog and cat.
Thus it happened that still nobody looked out into
the swirling rain. Why should they? Only to see the
wide deluged plain, the round drenched groves, the
<i>maraises</i> and sinuous <i>cool&eacute;es</i> shining with their floods,
and long lines of benumbed, wet cattle seeking in
patient, silent Indian file for warmer pastures. They
knew it all by heart.</p>

<p>Yonder farthest <i>&icirc;le</i> is Sosth&egrave;ne&rsquo;s. The falling flood
makes it almost undiscernible. Even if one looked,
he would not see that a number of horsemen have come
softly plashing up to Sosth&egrave;ne&rsquo;s front fence, for
Sosth&egrave;ne&rsquo;s house and grove are themselves in the way.
They spy Bonaventure. He is just going in upon the
gal&eacute;rie with an armful of China-tree fagots. Through
their guide and spokesman they utter, not the usual
halloo, but a quieter hail, with a friendly beckon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Adjieu.&rdquo; The men were bedraggled, and so wet
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
one could not make out the color of the dress. One
could hardly call it a uniform, and pretty certainly it
was not blue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Adjieu,&rdquo; responded Bonaventure, with some
alarm; but the spokesman smiled re-assuringly. He
pointed far away south-westward, and asked if a certain
green spot glimmering faintly through the rain
was not Chaouache&rsquo;s <i>&icirc;le</i>; and Bonaventure, dumb in
the sight of his prayer&rsquo;s answer, nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how do you get there?&rdquo; the man asks, still
in Acadian French; for he is well enough acquainted
with prairies to be aware that one needs to know the
road even to a place in full view across the plain.
Bonaventure, with riot in his heart, and feeling himself
drifting over the cataract of the sinfullest thing that
ever in his young life he has had the chance to do,
softly lays down his wood, and comes to the corner
of the gal&eacute;rie.</p>

<p>It is awful to him, even while he is doing it, the ease
with which he does it. If, he says, they find it troublesome
crossing the marshy place by Numa&rsquo;s farm,&mdash;<i>le
platin &agrave; cot&eacute; d&rsquo; l&rsquo;habitation &agrave; Numa</i>,&mdash;then it will
be well to <i>virer de bord</i>&mdash;go about, <i>et naviguer au
large</i>&mdash;sail across the open prairie. &ldquo;Adjieu.&rdquo; He
takes up his fagots again, and watches the spattering
squad trot away in the storm, wondering why there is
no storm in his own heart.</p>

<p>They are gone. Sosth&egrave;ne, inside the house, has
heard nothing. The tempest suffocates all sounds not
its own, and the wind is the wrong way anyhow.
Now they are far out in the open. Chaouache&rsquo;s <i>&icirc;le</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
still glimmers to them far ahead in the distance, but
if some one should only look from the front window
of its dwelling, he could see them coming. And that
would spoil the fun. So they get it into line with
another man&rsquo;s grove nearer by, and under that cover
quicken to a gallop. Away, away; splash, splash,
through the <i>cool&eacute;es</i>, around the <i>maraises</i>, clouds of
wild fowl that there is no time to shoot into rising now
on this side, now on that; snipe without number, gray
as the sky, with flashes of white, trilling petulantly as
they flee; giant snowy cranes lifting and floating away
on waving pinions, and myriads of ducks in great
eruptions of hurtling, whistling wings. On they gallop;
on they splash; heads down; water pouring from
soaked hats and caps; cold hands beating upon wet
breasts; horses throwing steaming muzzles down to
their muddy knees, and shaking the rain from their
worried ears; so on and on and on.</p>

<p>The horse-hair halter was nearly done. The breakfast
was smoking on the board. The eyes of the family
group were just turning toward it with glances of placid
content, when a knock sounded on the door, and almost
before father or son could rise or astonishment dart
from eye to eye, the door swung open, and a man
stood on the threshold, all mud and water and weapons,
touching the side of his cap with the edge of his
palm and asking in French, with an amused smile
forcing its way about his lips:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can fifteen of us get something to eat, and feed
our horses?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Chaouache gave a vacant stare, and silently started
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
toward the holsters that hung from the bedpost; but
the stranger&rsquo;s right hand flashed around to his own
belt, and, with a repeater half drawn, he cried:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Halt!&rdquo; And then, more quietly, &ldquo;Look out of
the door, look out the window.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Father and son looked. The house was surrounded.</p>

<p>Chaouache turned upon his wife one look of silent
despair. Wife and children threw themselves upon
his neck, weeping and wailing. &rsquo;Thanase bore the
sight a moment, maybe a full minute; then drew near,
pressed the children with kind firmness aside, pushed
between his father and mother, took her tenderly by
the shoulders, and said in their antique dialect, with
his own eyes brimming:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush! hush! he will not have to go.&rdquo;</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>At a gentle trot the short column of horsemen moves
again, but with its head the other way. The wind and
rain buffet and pelt horse and rider from behind.
Chaouache&rsquo;s door is still open. He stands in it with
his red-eyed wife beside him and the children around
them, all gazing mutely, with drooping heads and
many a slow tear, after the departing cavalcade.</p>

<p>None of the horsemen look back. Why should
they? To see a barefoot man beside a woman in dingy
<i>volante</i> and <i>casaquin</i>, with two or three lads of ten or
twelve in front, whose feet have known sunburn and
frost but never a shoe, and a damsel or two in cotton
homespun dress made of one piece from collar to hem,
and pantalettes of the same reaching to the ankles&mdash;all
standing and looking the picture of witless
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
incapacity, and making no plea against tyranny! Is that
a thing worth while to turn and look back upon? If
the blow fell upon ourselves or our set, that would be
different; but these illiterate and lowly ones&mdash;they
are&mdash;you don&rsquo;t know&mdash;so dull and insensible. Yes,
it may be true that it is only <em>some</em> of them who feel
less acutely than <em>some</em> of us&mdash;we admit that generously;
but when you insinuate that when we overlook
parental and fraternal anguish tearing at such hearts
the dulness and insensibility are ours, you make those
people extremely offensive to us, whereas you should
not estrange them from our tolerance.</p>

<p>Ah, poor unpitied mother! go back to your toils;
they are lightened now&mdash;a little; the cooking, the
washing, the scrubbing. Spread, day by day, the
smoking board, and call your spared husband and
your little ones to partake; but you&mdash;your tears shall
be your meat day and night, while underneath your
breath you moan, &ldquo;&rsquo;Thanase! &rsquo;Thanase!&rdquo;</p>

<h3><a name="PART_I_CHAP_V" id="PART_I_CHAP_V"></a>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<h3>THE CUR&Eacute; OF CARANCRO.</h3>


<p>It was an unexpected and capital exchange. They
had gone for a conscript; they came away with a
volunteer.</p>

<p>Bonaventure sat by the fire in Sosth&egrave;ne&rsquo;s cottage,
silent and heavy, holding his small knees in his knit
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
hands and gazing into the flames. Zos&eacute;phine was
washing the household&rsquo;s few breakfast dishes. <i>La
vieille</i>&mdash;the mother&mdash;was spinning cotton. <i>Le vieux</i>&mdash;Sosth&egrave;ne&mdash;sat
sewing up a rent in a rawhide chair-bottom.
He paused by and by, stretched, and went
to the window. His wife caught the same spirit of
relaxation, stopped her wheel, looked at the boy moping
in the chimney-corner, and, passing over to his
side, laid a hand upon his temple to see if he might
have fever.</p>

<p>The lad&rsquo;s eyes did not respond to her; they were
following Sosth&egrave;ne. The husband stood gazing out
through the glass for a moment, and then, without
moving, swore a long, slow execration. The wife and
daughter pressed quickly to his either side and looked
forth.</p>

<p>There they came, the number increased to eighteen
now, trotting leisurely through the subsiding storm.
The wife asked what they were, but Sosth&egrave;ne made no
reply; he was counting them: twelve, thirteen, fourteen&mdash;fourteen
with short guns, another one who
seemed to wear a sword, and three, that must be&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cawnscreep,&rdquo; growled Sosth&egrave;ne, without turning
his eyes. But the next moment an unusual sound at
his elbow drew his glance upon Zos&eacute;phine. &ldquo;<i>Diable!</i>&rdquo;
He glared at her weeping eyes, his manner demanding
of her instant explanation. She retreated a step,
moved her hand toward the approaching troop, and
cried distressfully:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Tu va o&egrave;re!</i>&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;You will see!&rdquo;</p>

<p>His glance was drawn to Bonaventure. The lad
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
had turned toward them, and was sitting upright, his
blue eyes widened, his face pale, and his lips apart;
but ere Sosth&egrave;ne could speak his wife claimed his
attention.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sosth&egrave;ne!&rdquo; she exclaimed, pressing against the
window-pane, &ldquo;ah, Sosth&egrave;ne! Ah, ah! they have got
&rsquo;Thanase!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Father, mother, and daughter crowded against the
window and one another, watching the body of horse
as it drew nigh. Bonaventure went slowly and lay
face downward on the bed.</p>

<p>Now the dripping procession is at hand. They pass
along the dooryard fence. At the little garden gate
they halt. Only &rsquo;Thanase dismounts. The commander
exchanges a smiling word or two with him,
and the youth passes through the gate, and, while his
companions throw each a tired leg over the pommel
and sit watching him, comes up the short, flowery walk
and in at the opening door.</p>

<p>There is nothing to explain, the family have guessed
it; he goes in his father&rsquo;s stead. There is but a
moment for farewells.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Adjieu, Bonaventure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The prostrate boy does not move. &rsquo;Thanase strides
up to the bed and looks at one burning cheek, then
turns to his aunt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Li malade?</i>&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Is he ill?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Sa l&rsquo;air a ca</i>,&rdquo; said the aunt. (<i>Il a l&rsquo;air</i>&mdash;he
seems so.)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bien, n&rsquo;onc&rsquo; Sosth&egrave;ne, adjieu.&rdquo; Uncle and
nephew shake hands stoutly. &ldquo;Adjieu,&rdquo; says the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
young soldier again to his aunt. She gives her hand
and turns to hide a tear. The youth takes one step
toward Zos&eacute;phine. She stands dry-eyed, smiling on
her father. As the youth comes her eyes, without
turning to him, fill. He puts out his hand. She lays
her own on it. He gazes at her for a moment, with
beseeching eye&mdash;&ldquo;Adjieu.&rdquo; Her eyes meet his one
instant&mdash;she leaps upon his neck&mdash;his strong arms
press her to his bosom&mdash;her lifted face lights up&mdash;his
kiss is on her lips&mdash;it was there just now, and
now&mdash;&rsquo;Thanase is gone, and she has fled to an inner
room.</p>

<p>Bonaventure stood in the middle of the floor. Why
should the boy look so strange? Was it anger, or
fever, or joy? He started out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>A ou-ce-tu va Bonaventure?</i>&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Whereabouts
are you going?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Va crier les vaches.</i>&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Going to call the cows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At this time of day?&rdquo; demanded <i>la vieille</i>, still in
the same tongue. &ldquo;Are you crazy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&mdash;no!&rdquo; the boy replied, looking dazed.
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I was going for some more wood.&rdquo;
He went out, passed the woodpile by, got round behind
a corn-crib, and stood in the cold, wet gale watching
the distant company lessening on the view. It was but
a short, dim, dark streak, creeping across the field of
vision like some slow insect on a window-glass. A
spot just beyond it was a grove that would presently
shut the creeping line finally from sight. They reached
it, passed beyond, and disappeared; and then Bonaventure
took off the small, soft-brimmed hat that hung
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
about his eyes, and, safe from the sight and hearing of
all his tiny world, lifted his voice, and with face kindling
with delight swung the sorry covering about his
head and cried three times:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ora! Or-r-ra! Ora-a-a-a!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But away in the night Madame Sosth&egrave;ne, hearing an
unwonted noise, went to Bonaventure&rsquo;s bedside and
found him sobbing as if his heart had broken.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has had a bad dream,&rdquo; she said; for he would
not say a word.</p>

<p>The cur&eacute; of Vermilionville and Carancro was a
Creole gentleman who looked burly and hard when in
meditation; but all that vanished when he spoke and
smiled. In the pocket of his cassock there was always
a deck of cards, but that was only for the game of
solitaire. You have your pipe or cigar, your flute or
violoncello; he had his little table under the orange-tree
and his game of solitaire.</p>

<p>He was much loved. To see him beyond earshot
talking to other men you would say he was by nature
a man of affairs, whereas, when you came to hear
him speak you find him quite another sort: one of
the Elisha kind, as against the Elijahs; a man of the
domestic sympathies, whose influence on man was
personal and familiar; one of the sort that heal bitter
waters with a handful of salt, make poisonous pottage
wholesome with a little meal, and find easy, quiet
ways to deliver poor widows from their creditors with
no loss to either; a man whom men reverenced, while
women loved and children trusted him.</p>

<p>The ex-governor was fond of his company, although
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
the cur&eacute; only smiled at politics and turned the conversation
back to family matters. He had a natural gift
for divining men&rsquo;s, women&rsquo;s, children&rsquo;s personal wants,
and every one&rsquo;s distinctively from every other one&rsquo;s.
So that to everybody he was an actual personal friend.
He had been a long time in this region. It was he
who buried Bonaventure&rsquo;s mother. He was the connecting
link between Bonaventure and the ex-governor.
Whenever the cur&eacute; met this man of worldly power,
there were questions asked and answered about the
lad.</p>

<p>A little after &rsquo;Thanase&rsquo;s enlistment the priest and
the ex-governor, who, if I remember right, was home
only transiently from camp, met on the court-house
square of Vermilionville, and stood to chat a bit, while
others contemplated from across the deep mud of the
street these two interesting representatives of sword
and gown. Two such men standing at that time must
naturally, one would say, have been talking of the
strength of the defences around Richmond, or the
Emperor Maximilian&rsquo;s operations in Mexico, or Kirby
Smith&rsquo;s movements, hardly far enough away to make
it seem comfortable. But in reality they were talking
about &rsquo;Thanase.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He cannot write,&rdquo; said the cur&eacute;; &ldquo;and if he could,
no one at home could read his letters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The ex-governor promised to look after him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;does Sosth&egrave;ne&rsquo;s little orphan get on?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The cur&eacute; smiled. &ldquo;He is well&mdash;physically. A
queer, high-strung child; so old, yet so young. In
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
some things he will be an infant as long as he lives;
in others, he has been old from the cradle. He takes
every thing in as much earnest as a man of fifty.
What is to become of him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! he will come out all right,&rdquo; said the ex-governor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That depends. Some children are born with fixed
characters: you can tell almost from the start what
they are going to be. Be they much or little, they are
complete in themselves, and it makes comparatively
little difference into what sort of a world you drop
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Thanase, for instance,&rdquo; said the ex-governor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you might say &rsquo;Thanase; but never Bonaventure.
He is the other type; just as marked and
positive traits, but those traits not yet builded into
character: a loose mass of building-material, and the
beauty or ugliness to which such a nature may arrive
depends on who and what has the building of it into
form. What he may turn out to be at last will be no
mere product of circumstances; he is too original for
that. Oh, he&rsquo;s a study! Another boy under the same
circumstances might turn out entirely different; and
yet it will make an immense difference how his experiences
are allowed to combine with his nature.&rdquo; The
speaker paused a moment, while Bonaventure&rsquo;s other
friend stood smiling with interest; then the priest
added, &ldquo;He is just now struggling with his first great
experience.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It belongs,&rdquo; replied the cur&eacute;, smiling in his turn,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
&ldquo;to the confidences of the confessional. But,&rdquo; he
added, with a little anxious look, &ldquo;I can tell you what
it will do; it will either sweeten his whole nature more
and more, or else make it more and more bitter, from
this time forth. And that is no trifle to you or me;
for whether for good or bad, in a large way or in a
small way, he is going to make himself felt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The ex-governor mused. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad the little fellow
has you for a friend, father.&mdash;I&rsquo;ll tell you; if
Sosth&egrave;ne and his wife will part with him, and you will
take him to live with you, and, mark you, not try too
hard to make a priest of him, I will bear his expenses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will do it,&rdquo; said the cur&eacute;.</p>

<p>It required much ingenuity of argument to make the
Gradnego pair see the matter in the desired light; but
when the cur&eacute; promised Sosth&egrave;ne that he would teach
the lad to read and write, and then promised <i>la vieille</i>
that Zos&eacute;phine should share this educational privilege
with him, they let him go.</p>

<p>Zos&eacute;phine was not merely willing, but eager, to see
the arrangements made. She beckoned the boy aside
and spoke to him alone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must go, Bonaventure. You will go, will you
not&mdash;when I ask you? Think how fine that will be&mdash;to
be educated! For me, I cannot endure an uneducated
person. But&mdash;ah! <i>ca sr&eacute; vaillant, pour
savoir lire</i>. [It will be bully to know how to read.]
<i>Aie ya yaie!</i>&rdquo;&mdash;she stretched her eyes and bit her lip
with delight&mdash;&ldquo;<i>C&rsquo;est t&rsquo;y gai, pour savoir &eacute;crire!</i>
[That&rsquo;s fine to know how to write.] I will tell you a
secret, dear Bonaventure. Any girl of sense is <em>bound</em>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
to think it much greater and finer for a man to read
books than to ride horses. She may not want to, but
she has to do it; she can&rsquo;t help herself!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Still Bonaventure looked at her mournfully. She
tried again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I say any girl of sense I include myself&mdash;of
course! I think more of a boy&mdash;or man, either&mdash;who
can write letters than of one who can play the
fiddle. There, now, I have told you! And when you
have learned those things, I will be proud of you!
And besides, you know, if you don&rsquo;t go, you make me
lose my chance of learning the same things; but if you
go, we will learn them together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He consented. She could not understand the expression
of his face. She had expected gleams of
delight. There were none. He went with silent docility,
and without a tear; but also without a smile.
When in his new home the cur&eacute; from time to time stole
glances at his face fixed in unconscious revery, it was
full of a grim, unhappy satisfaction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Self is winning, or dying hard. I wish no ill to
&rsquo;Thanase; but if there is to be any bad news of him,
I hope, for the sake of this boy&rsquo;s soul, it will come
quickly.&rdquo; So spoke the cur&eacute; alone, to his cards.</p>

<h3><a name="PART_I_CHAP_VI" id="PART_I_CHAP_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<h3>MISSING.</h3>


<p>The war was in its last throes even when &rsquo;Thanase
enlisted. Weeks and months passed. Then a soldier
coming home to Carancro&mdash;home-comers were growing
plentiful&mdash;brought the first news of him. An
officer making up a force of picked men for an expedition
to carry important despatches eastward across the
Mississippi and far away into Virginia had chosen
&rsquo;Thanase. The evening the speaker left for home on
his leave of absence &rsquo;Thanase was still in camp, but
was to start the next morning. It was just after Sunday
morning mass that Sosth&egrave;ne and Chaouache, with
their families and friends, crowded around this bearer
of tidings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Had &rsquo;Thanase been in any battles?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, two or three.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And had not been wounded?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, although he was the bravest fellow in his
company.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sosth&egrave;ne and Chaouache looked at each other triumphantly,
smiled, and swore two simultaneous oaths
of admiration. Zos&eacute;phine softly pinched her mother,
and whispered something. Madame Sosth&egrave;ne addressed
the home-comer aloud:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did &rsquo;Thanase send no other message except that
mere &lsquo;How-d&rsquo;ye all do?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
Zos&eacute;phine leaned upon her mother&rsquo;s shoulder, and
softly breathed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is lying.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The mother looked around upon her daughter in
astonishment. The flash of scorn was just disappearing
from the girl&rsquo;s eyes. She gave a little smile and
chuckle, and murmured, with her glance upon the
man:</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has no leave of absence. He is a deserter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Madame Sosth&egrave;ne saw two things at once:
that the guess was a good one, and that Zos&eacute;phine
had bidden childhood a final &ldquo;adjieu.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The daughter felt Bonaventure&rsquo;s eyes upon her.
He was standing only a step or two away. She gave
him a quick, tender look that thrilled him from head
to foot, then lifted her brows and made a grimace of
pretended weariness. She was growing prettier almost
from day to day.</p>

<p>And Bonaventure, he had no playmates&mdash;no comrades&mdash;no
amusements. This one thing, which no
one knew but the cur&eacute;, had taken possession of him.
The priest sometimes seemed to himself cruel, so well
did it please him to observe the magnitude Bonaventure
plainly attributed to the matter. The boy seemed
almost physically to bow under the burden of his
sense of guilt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is quickening all his faculties,&rdquo; said the cur&eacute;
to himself. Zos&eacute;phine had hardly yet learned to read
without stammering, when Bonaventure was already
devouring the few French works of the cur&eacute;&rsquo;s small
bookshelf. Silent on other subjects, on one he would
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
talk till a pink spot glowed on either cheek-bone and
his blue eyes shone like a hot noon sky;&mdash;casuistry.
He would debate the right and wrong of any thing,
every thing, and the rights and wrongs of men in every
relation of life.</p>

<p>Blessed was it for him then that the tactful cur&eacute;
was his father and mother in one, and the surgeon
and physician of his mind. Thus the struggle brought
him light. To the boy&rsquo;s own eyes it seemed to be
bringing him only darkness, but the priest saw better.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is but his shadow; he is standing in it; it is
deepening; that shows the light is increasing.&rdquo; Thus
spake the cur&eacute; to himself as he sat at solitaire under
his orange-tree one afternoon.</p>

<p>The boy passed out of sight, and the cur&eacute;&rsquo;s eyes
returned to his game of solitaire; but as he slowly
laid one card upon another, now here, now there, he
still thought of Bonaventure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There will be no peace for him, no sweetness of
nature, no green pastures and still waters, within or
without, while he seeks life&rsquo;s adjustments through
definitions of mere right and rights. No, boy; you
will ever be a restless captive, pacing round and round
those limits of your enclosure. Worse still if you
seek those definitions only to justify your overriding
another&rsquo;s happiness in pursuit of your own.&rdquo; The boy
was not in hearing; this was apostrophe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bonaventure,&rdquo; he said, as the lad came by again;
and Bonaventure stopped. The player pushed the
cards from him, pile by pile, leaned back, ran his
fingers slowly through his thin gray hair, and smiled.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
&ldquo;Bonaventure, I have a riddle for you. It came
to me as I was playing here just now. If everybody
could do just as he pleased; if he had, as the governor
would say, all his rights,&mdash;life, liberty, pursuit of
happiness,&mdash;if everybody had this, I say, why should
we still be unhappy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boy was silent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I did not suppose you would know. Would
you like me to tell you? It is because happiness pursued
is never overtaken. And can you guess why
that is? Well, never mind, my son. But&mdash;would
you like to do something for me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bonaventure nodded. The cur&eacute; rose, taking from
his bosom as he left his chair a red silk handkerchief
and a pocket-worn note-book. He laid the note-book
on the table, and drawing back with a smile said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, sit down in my place, and write what I tell
you, while I stretch my legs. So; never mind whether
you understand or not. I am saying it for myself: it
helps <em>me</em> to understand it better. Now, as I walk,
you write. &lsquo;Happiness pursued is never overtaken,
because&rsquo;&mdash;have you written that?&mdash;&lsquo;because, little
as we are, God&rsquo;s image makes us so large that we
cannot live within ourselves, nor even for ourselves,
and be satisfied.&rsquo; Have you got that down? Very
well&mdash;yes&mdash;the spelling could be improved, but that
is no matter. Now wait a moment; let me walk some
more. Now write: &lsquo;It is not good for man to be
alone, because&rsquo;&mdash;because&mdash;let me see; where&mdash;ah,
yes!&mdash;&lsquo;because rightly self is the&rsquo;&mdash;Ah! no, no,
my boy; not a capital S for &lsquo;self&rsquo;&mdash;ah! that&rsquo;s the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
very point,&mdash;small <em>s</em>,&mdash;&lsquo;because rightly self is the
smallest part of us. Even God found it good not
to be alone, but to create&rsquo;&mdash;got that?&mdash;&lsquo;to create
objects for His love and benevolence.&rsquo; Yes&mdash;&lsquo;And
because in my poor, small way I am made like Him,
the whole world becomes a part of me&rsquo;&mdash;small <em>m</em>,
yes, that is right!&rdquo; From bending a moment over
the writer, the priest straightened up and took a step
backward. The boy lifted his glance to where the
sunlight and leaf-shadows were playing on his guardian&rsquo;s
face. The cur&eacute; answered with a warm smile,
saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;My boy, God is a very practical God&mdash;no, you
need not write it; just listen a moment. Yes; and so
when He gave us natures like His, He gave men not
wives only, but brethren and sisters and companions
and strangers, in order that benevolence, yes, and even
self-sacrifice,&mdash;mistakenly so called,&mdash;might have no
lack of direction and occupation; and then bound the
whole human family together by putting every one&rsquo;s
happiness into some other one&rsquo;s hands. I see you do
not understand: never mind; it will come to you little
by little. It was a long time coming to me. Let us
go in to supper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The good man had little hope of such words taking
hold. At school next day there was Zos&eacute;phine with
her soft electric glances to make the boy forget all;
and at the Saturday-night balls there she was again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bonaventure,&rdquo; her manner plainly said, &ldquo;did you
ever see any thing else in this wide world so tiresome
as these boys about here? Stay with me; it keeps
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
them away.&rdquo; She never put such thoughts into words.
With an Acadian girl such a thing was impossible
But girls do not need words. She drew as potently,
and to all appearances as impassively, as a loadstone.
All others than Bonaventure she repelled. If now
and then she toyed with a heart, it was but to see her
image in it once or twice and toss it aside. All got
one treatment in the main. Any one of them might
gallop by her father&rsquo;s veranda seven times a day, but
not once in all the seven would she be seen at the
window glancing up at the weather or down at her
flowers; nor on the veranda hanging up fresh hanks
of yarn; nor at the well with the drinking-pail, getting
fresh water, as she might so easily have been, had
she so chosen. Yonder was Sosth&egrave;ne hoeing leisurely
in the little garden, and possibly the sunbonnet of
<i>la vieille</i> half seen and half hidden among her lima-beans;
but for the rest there was only the house,
silent at best, or, worse, sending out through its half-open
door the long, scornful No-o-o! of the maiden&rsquo;s
unseen spinning-wheel. No matter the fame or grace
of the rider. All in vain, my lad: pirouette as you
will; sit your gallantest; let your hat blow off, and
turn back, and at full speed lean down from the saddle,
and snatch it airily from the ground, and turn again
and gallop away; all is in vain. For by her estimate
either you are living in fear of the conscript officer;
or, if you are in the service, and here only transiently
on leave of absence, your stay seems long, and it is
rumored your leave has expired; or, worse, you cannot
read; or, worst, your age, for all your manly airs,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
is so near Zos&eacute;phine&rsquo;s as to give your attentions strong
savor of presumption. But let any fortune bring
Bonaventure in any guise&mdash;sorriest horseman of all,
youngest, slenderest, and stranger to all the ways that
youth loves&mdash;and at once she is visible; nay, more,
accessible; and he, welcome. So accessible she, so
welcome he, that more than once she has to waft aside
her mother&rsquo;s criticisms by pleading Bonaventure&rsquo;s foster-brotherhood
and her one or two superior years.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor &rsquo;Thanase!&rdquo; said the youths and maidens.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>And now the war came to an end. Bonaventure
was glad. &rsquo;Thanase was expected home, but&mdash;let
him come. If the absent soldier knew what the young
folks at the balls knew, he would not make haste in
his return. And he did not, as it seemed. Day after
day, in group after group, without shouting and without
banners, with wounds and scars and tattered garments,
some on horses, but many more on foot, the
loved ones&mdash;the spared ones, remnants of this command
and that command and &rsquo;Thanase&rsquo;s command&mdash;came
home. But day by day brought no &rsquo;Thanase.</p>

<p>Bonaventure began to wish for him anxiously. He
wanted him back so that this load might be lifted.
Thus the bitter would pass out of the sweet; the haunting
fear of evil tidings from the absent rival would
haunt no more. Life would be what it was to other
lads, and Zos&eacute;phine one day fall to his share by a
better title than he could ever make with &rsquo;Thanase in
exile. Come, &rsquo;Thanase, come, come!</p>

<p>More weeks passed. The youth&rsquo;s returned
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
comrades were all back at their ploughs again and among
their herds. &rsquo;Thanase would be along by and by,
they said; he could not come with them, for he had not
been paroled with them; he had been missing&mdash;taken
prisoner, no doubt&mdash;in the very last fight. But presently
they who had been prisoners were home also, and
still &rsquo;Thanase had not come. And then, instead of
&rsquo;Thanase coming, Chaouache died.</p>

<p>A terror took up its home in the heart of Bonaventure.
Every thing he looked upon, every creature that
looked upon him, seemed to offer an unuttered accusation.
Least of all could he bear the glance of Zos&eacute;phine.
He did not have to bear it. She kept at home
now closely. She had learned to read, and Sosth&egrave;ne
and his <i>vieille</i> had pronounced her education completed.</p>

<p>In one direction only could the eyes of Bonaventure
go, and meet nothing that accused him: that was into
the face of the cur&eacute;. And lest accusation should
spring up there, he had omitted his confession for
weeks. He was still child enough not to see that the
priest was watching him narrowly and tenderly.</p>

<p>One night, away in the small hours, the cur&eacute; was
aroused by the presence of some one in his room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is that?&rdquo; He rose from his pillow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is I, father,&rdquo; said a low voice, and against the
darkness of an inner door he saw dimly the small, long
nightdress of the boy he loved.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What gets you up, Bonaventure? Come here.
What troubles you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot sleep,&rdquo; murmured the lad, noiselessly
moving near. The priest stroked the lad&rsquo;s brow.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
&ldquo;Have you not been asleep at all?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you have had bad dreams that woke you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what was that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you dream about&mdash;&rsquo;Thanase, for example?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The priest reached out and took the boy&rsquo;s small,
slender hands in his. They were moist and cold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And did you dream&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dreamed he was dead. I dream it every night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, my child, that does not make it so. Would
you like to get into bed here with me? No?&mdash;or to
go back now to your own bed? No? What, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not want to go back to bed any more. I
want to go and find &rsquo;Thanase.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, my child, you are not thoroughly awake,
are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I want to go and find &rsquo;Thanase. I have been
thinking to-night of all you have told me&mdash;of all you
said that day in the garden,&mdash;and&mdash;I want to go and
find &rsquo;Thanase.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My boy,&rdquo; said the priest, drawing the lad with
gentle force to his bosom, &ldquo;my little old man, does
this mean that you have come to the end of all self-service?&mdash;that
self is never going to be spelt with a
capital S any more? Will it be that way if I let you
go?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, my son&mdash;God only knows whether I
am wise or foolish, but&mdash;you may go.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
The boy smiled for the first time in weeks, then
climbed half upon the bed, buried his face in the
priest&rsquo;s bosom, and sobbed as though his heart had
broken.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has broken,&rdquo; said the cur&eacute; to himself as he
clasped him tightly. &ldquo;It has broken&mdash;thank God!&rdquo;</p>

<h3><a name="PART_I_CHAP_VII" id="PART_I_CHAP_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII.</h3>

<h3>A NEEDLE IN A HAYSTACK.</h3>


<p>In such and such a battle, in the last charge across
a certain cornfield, or in the hurried falling back
through a certain wood, with the murderous lead singing
and hitting from yonder dark mass descending on
the flank, and the air full of imperious calls, &ldquo;Halt!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Surrender!&rdquo;
a man disappeared. He was not
with those who escaped, nor with the dead when they
were buried, nor among the wounded anywhere, nor in
any group of prisoners. But long after the war was
over, another man, swinging a bush scythe among the
overgrown corners of a worm fence, found the poor
remnant of him, put it scarcely underground, and that
was the end. How many times that happened!</p>

<p>Was it so with &rsquo;Thanase? No. For Sosth&egrave;ne&rsquo;s
sake the ex-governor had taken much pains to correspond
with officials concerning the missing youth, and
had secured some slender re-assurances. &rsquo;Thanase,
though captured, had not been taken to prison.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
Tidings of general surrender had overhauled him on the
way to it, near, I think, the city of Baltimore&mdash;somewhere
in that region, at any rate; and he had been
paroled and liberated, and had started penniless and
on foot, south-westward along the railway-tracks.</p>

<p>To find him, Bonaventure must set out, like him on
foot, south-eastward over some fifty miles of wagon-road
to the nearest railway; eastward again over its
cross-ties eighty miles to <i>la ville</i>, the great New
Orleans, there to cross the Mississippi. Then away
northward, through the deep, trestled swamps, leagues
and leagues, across Bayou La Branche and Bayou
Desair, and Pass Manchac and North Manchac, and
Pontchatoula River two or three times; and out of the
swamps and pine barrens into the sweet pine hills,
with their great resinous boles rising one hundred&mdash;two
hundred feet overhead; over meadows and fields
and many and many a beautiful clear creek, and ten
or more times over the winding Tangipahoa, by narrow
clearings, and the old tracks of forgotten hurricanes,
and many a wide plantation; until more than two hundred
miles from the great city, still northward across
the sinking and swelling fields, the low, dark dome
of another State&rsquo;s Capitol must rise amid spires and
trees into the blue, and the green ruins of fortifications
be passed, and the iron roads be found branching west,
north, and east.</p>

<p>Thence all was one wide sea of improbability. Even
before a quarter of that distance should have been
covered, how many chances of every sort there were
against the success of such a search!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
&ldquo;It is impossible that he should find him,&rdquo; said the
ex-governor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;&mdash;the cur&eacute; shrugged,&mdash;&ldquo;if he finds no one,
yet he may succeed in losing himself.&rdquo; But in order
that Bonaventure in losing himself should not be lost,
the priest gave him pens and paper, and took his
promise to write back as he went step by step out into
the world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And learn English, my boy; learn it with all
speed; you will find it vastly, no telling how vastly, to
your interest&mdash;I should say your usefulness. I am
sorry I could not teach it to you myself. Here is a
little spelling-book and reader for you to commence
with. Make haste to know English; in America we
should be Americans; would that I could say it to all
our Acadian people! but I say it to you, learn English.
It may be that by not knowing it you may fail, or by
knowing it succeed, in this errand. And every step
of your way let your first business be the welfare of
others. Hundreds will laugh at you for it: never
mind; it will bring you through. Yes, I will tell Sosth&egrave;ne
and the others good-by for you. I will tell
them you had a dream that compelled you to go at
once. Adieu.&rdquo; And just as the rising sun&rsquo;s first
beam smote the cur&eacute;&rsquo;s brimming eyes, his &ldquo;little old
man&rdquo; turned his face toward a new life, and set forward
to enter it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you seen anywhere, coming back from the
war, a young man named &rsquo;Thanase Beausoleil?&rdquo;&mdash;This
question to every one met, day in, day out, in
early morning lights, in noonday heats, under sunset
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
glows, by a light figure in thin, clean clothing, dusty
shoes, and with limp straw hat lowered from the head.
By and by, as first the land of the Acadians and then
the land of the Creoles was left behind, a man every
now and then would smile and shake his head to mean
he did not understand&mdash;for the question was in French.
But then very soon it began to be in English too, and
by and by not in French at all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir, have you seen anywhere, coming back from
the war, a young man named &rsquo;Thanase Beausoleil?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But no one had seen him.</p>

<p>Travel was very slow. Not only because it was
done afoot. Many a day he had to tarry to earn
bread, for he asked no alms. But after a while he
passed eastward into a third State, and at length into
the mountains of a fourth.</p>

<p>Meantime the weeks were lengthening into months;
the year was in its decline. Might not &rsquo;Thanase be
even then at home? No. Every week Bonaventure
wrote back, &ldquo;Has he come?&rdquo; and the answer came
back, &ldquo;He is not here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But one evening, as he paced the cross-ties of a railway
that hugged a huge forest-clad mountain-side,
with the valley a thousand feet below, its stony river
shining like a silken fabric in the sunset lights, the
great hillsides clad in crimson, green, and gold, and
the long, trailing smoke of the last train&mdash;a rare,
motionless blue gauze&mdash;gone to rest in the chill mid-air,
he met a man who suddenly descended upon the
track in front of him from higher up the mountain,&mdash;a
great, lank mountaineer. And when Bonaventure
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
asked the apparition the untiring question to which so
many hundreds had answered No, the tall man looked
down upon the questioner, a bright smile suddenly
lighting up the unlovely chin-whiskered face, and
asked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Makes a fiddle thess talk an&rsquo; cry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, he hain&rsquo;t been gone from hyer two weeks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was true. Only a few weeks before, gaunt, footsore,
and ragged, tramping the cross-ties yonder where
the railway comes from the eastward, curving into view
out of that deep green and gray defile, &rsquo;Thanase had
come into this valley. So short a time before, because
almost on his start homeward illness had halted him
by the way and held him long in arrest. But at length
he had reached the valley, and had lingered here for
days; for it happened that a man in bought clothing
was there just then, roaming around and hammering
pieces off the rocks, who gave &rsquo;Thanase the chance to
earn a little something from him, with which the hard-marched
wanderer might take the train instead of the
cross-ties for as far as the pittance would carry him.</p>

<h3><a name="PART_I_CHAP_VIII" id="PART_I_CHAP_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>

<h3>THE QUEST ENDED.</h3>


<p>The next sunrise saw Bonaventure, with a new energy
in his step, journeying back the way he had come.
And so anew the weeks wore by. Once more the
streams ran southward, and the landscapes opened
wide and fertile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir,&mdash;pardon your stopping,&mdash;in what State
should I find myself at the present?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The person inquired of looked blank, examined the
questioner from head to foot, and replied:</p>

<p>&ldquo;In what&mdash;oh! I understand; yes. What State&mdash;Alabama,
yes, Alabama. You must excuse me,
I didn&rsquo;t understand you at first. Yes, this is
Alabama.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir. Have you seen anywhere, coming
back from the war, a young man named &rsquo;Thanase
Beausoleil?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Back from the war! Why, everybody done got
back from the war long ago.&rdquo; &ldquo;Lawng ago-o-o,&rdquo;
the speaker pronounced it, but the pronunciation could
not be as untrue as the careless assertion.</p>

<p>A second time, and again a third, Bonaventure fell
upon the trail. But each time it was colder than
before. And yet he was pushing on as fast as he
dared. Many a kind man&rsquo;s invitation to tarry and
rest was gratefully declined. Once, where two railways
parted, one leading south, the other west, he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
followed the southern for days, and then came back
to the point of separation, and by and by found the
lost thread again on the more westward road. But
the time since &rsquo;Thanase had passed was the longest yet.
Was it certainly &rsquo;Thanase? Yes; the fiddle always
settled that question. And had he not got home? He
had not come. Somewhere in the long stretch between
Bonaventure and Carancro there must be strange
tidings.</p>

<p>On the first New Year&rsquo;s eve after the war, as the
sun was sinking upon the year&rsquo;s end, Bonaventure
turned that last long curve of the New Orleans, Jackson,
and Great Northern Railroad, through the rushes,
flags, willows, and cypress-stumps of the cleared
swamp behind the city of the Creoles, and, passing
around the poor shed called the depot, paused at the
intersection of Calliope and Magnolia Streets, waiting
the turn of chance.</p>

<p>Trace of the lost &rsquo;Thanase had brought him at length
to this point. The word of a fellow-tramp, pledged
on the honor of his guild, gave assurance that thus far
the wanted man had come in strength and hope&mdash;but
more than a month before.</p>

<p>The necessity of moving on presently carried Bonaventure
aimlessly into the city along the banks of the
New Canal. The lad had shot up in these few months
into the full stature, without the breadth, of manhood.
The first soft, uneven curls of a light-brown beard
were on his thin cheek and chin. Patient weariness
and humble perseverance were in his eyes. His coarse,
ill-matched attire was whole and, but for the soilure
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
of foot-travel, clean. Companioning with nature had
browned his skin, and dried his straight fine hair.
Any reader of faces would have seen the lines of unselfish
purpose about his lips, and, when they parted
nervously for speech, the earnest glow of that purpose
in a countenance that neither smiled nor frowned,
and, though it was shaded, cast no shadow.</p>

<p>The police very soon knew him. They smiled at
one another and tapped the forehead with one finger,
as he turned away with his question answered by a
shake of the head. It became their habit. They would
jerk a thumb over a shoulder after him facetiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goes to see every unknown white man found dead
or drowned. And yet, you know, he&rsquo;s happy. He&rsquo;s
a heap sight&rdquo;&mdash;sometimes they used other adjectives&mdash;&ldquo;a
heap sight happier than us, with his trampin&rsquo;
around all day and his French and English books at
night, as old Tony says. He bunks with old Tony,
you know, what keeps that little grocery in Solidelle
Street. Tony says his candles comes to more than his
bread and meat, or, rather, his rice and crawfish. He&rsquo;s
the funniest crazy <em>I</em> ever see. All the crazies I ever
see is got some grind for pleasing number one; but
this chap is everlastin&rsquo;ly a-lookin&rsquo; out for everybody
<em>but</em> number one. Oh, yes, the candles and books,&mdash;I
reckon they are for number one,&mdash;that&rsquo;s so; but
anyhow, that&rsquo;s what I hear Madame Tony allow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The short, wet winter passed. The search stretched
on into the spring. It did not, by far, take up the
seeker&rsquo;s whole daily life. Only it was a thread that
ran all through it, a dye that colored it. Many other
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
factors&mdash;observations, occupations, experiences&mdash;were
helping to make up that life, and to make it, with
all its pathetic slenderness, far more than it was likely
ever to have been made at Carancro. Through hundreds
of miles of tramping the lad had seen, in a singularly
complete yet inhostile disentanglement from it,
the world of men; glimpses of the rich man&rsquo;s world
with its strivings, steadier views of the poor man&rsquo;s
world with its struggles. The times were strong and
rude. Every step of his way had been through a land
whose whole civil order had been condemned, shattered,
and cast into the mill of revolution for a total remoulding.
Every day came like the discharge of a great
double-shotted gun. It could not but be that, humble
as his walk was, and his years so few, his fevered mind
should leap into the questions of the hour like a naked
boy into the surf. He made mistakes, sometimes in
a childish, sometimes in an older way, some against
most worthy things. But withal he managed to keep
the main direction of truth, after his own young way
of thinking and telling it. He had no such power to
formulate his large conclusions as you or even I have;
but whatever wrought to enlighten the unlettered,
whatever cherished manhood&rsquo;s rights alike in lofty and
lowly, whatever worked the betterment of the poor,
whatever made man not too much and not too little his
brother&rsquo;s keeper,&mdash;his keeper not by mastery, but by
fraternal service,&mdash;whatever did these things was to
him good religion, good politics. So, at least, the
cur&eacute; told the ex-governor, as from time to time they
talked of the absent Bonaventure and of his letters.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
However, they had to admit one thing: all this did
not find &rsquo;Thanase.</p>

<p>And why, now, should &rsquo;Thanase longer be sought?
Was there any thing to gain by finding him dead?
Not for Bonaventure; he felt, as plainly as though he
had seen an angel write the decree, that to Bonaventure
Deschamps no kind of profit or advantage under
the sun must come by such a way. But was there any
thing to be gained in finding that &rsquo;Thanase still lived?
The police will tell you, as they told Bonaventure, that
in these days of steam and steel and yoked lightning
a man may get lost and be found again; but that
when he stays lost, and is neither dead nor mad, it is
because he wants to be lost. So where was to be the
gain in finding &rsquo;Thanase alive? Oh, much, indeed, to
Bonaventure! The star of a new hope shot up into
his starless sky when that thought came, and in that
star trembled that which he had not all these weary
months of search dared see even with fancy&rsquo;s eye,&mdash;the
image of Zos&eacute;phine! This&mdash;this! that he had
never set out to achieve&mdash;this! if he could but stand
face to face with evidence that &rsquo;Thanase could have
reached home and would not.</p>

<p>This thought was making new lines in the young
care-struck face, when&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;See here,&rdquo; said a voice one day. Bonaventure&rsquo;s
sleeve was caught by the thumb and forefinger of a
man to whom, in passing, he had touched his hat.
The speaker was a police captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come with me.&rdquo; They turned and walked, Bonaventure
saying not a word. They passed a corner,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
turned to the right, passed two more, turned to the
left,&mdash;high brick walls on either side, damp, ill-smelling
pavements under foot,&mdash;and still strode on in
silence. As they turned once more to the right in a
dim, narrow way, the captain patted the youth softly
on the back, and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ask me no questions, and I&rsquo;ll tell you no lies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Bonaventure asked none. But presently, in one
of those dens called sailors&rsquo; boarding-houses, somewhere
down on the water-front near the Mint, he was
brought face to face with a stranger whose manner
seemed to offer the reverse proposition. Of him the
youth asked questions and got answers.</p>

<p>&rsquo;Thanase Beausoleil still lived, far beyond seas.
How? why? If this man spake truly, because here in
New Orleans, at the last turn in the long, weary journey
that was to have brought the young volunteer
home, he had asked and got the aid of this informant
to ship&mdash;before the mast&mdash;for foreign parts. But
why? Because his ambition and pride, explained the
informant, had outgrown Carancro, and his heart had
tired of the diminished memory of the little Zos&eacute;phine.</p>

<p>Bonaventure hurried away. What storms buffeted
one another in his bosom!</p>

<p>Night had fallen upon the great city. Long stretches
of street lay now between high walls, and now between
low-hanging eaves, empty of human feet and rife with
solitude. Through long distances he could run and
leap, and make soft, mild pretence of shouting and
smiting hands. The quest was ended! rivalry gone
of its own choice, guilt washed from the hands, love
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
returned to her nest. Zos&eacute;phine! Zos&eacute;phine! Away
now, away to the reward of penance, patience, and
loyalty! Unsought, unhoped-for reward! As he ran,
the crescent moon ran before him in the sky, and one
glowing star, dipping low, beckoned him into the west.</p>

<p>And yet that night a great riot broke out in his
heart; and in the morning there was a look on his face
as though in that tumult conscience had been drugged,
beaten, stoned, and left for dead outside the gate of
his soul.</p>

<p>There was something of defiance in his eye, not good
to see, as he started down the track of the old Opelousas
Railroad, with the city and the Mississippi at
his back. When he had sent a letter ahead of him,
he had no money left to pay for railway passage.
Should he delay for that or aught else, he might never
start; for already the ghost of conscience was whispering
in at the barred windows of his heart:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not true. The man has told you falsely. It
is not true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so he was tramping once more&mdash;toward Carancro.
And never before with such determined eagerness.
Nothing could turn him about now. Once a train came
in sight in front of him just as he had started across
a trestle-work; but he ran forward across the open
ties, and leaped clear of the track on the farther side,
just when another instant would have been too late.
He stood a moment, only half-pausing among the palmettos
and rushes as the hurtling mass thundered by;
then pushed quickly into the whirling dust of the track
and hurried on between the clicking rails, not knowing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
that yonder dark, dwindling speck behind was bearing
away from him strange tidings from the cur&eacute;.</p>

<p>The summer was coming on; the suns were hot.
There were leagues on leagues of unbroken shaking
prairie with never a hand-breadth of shade, but only
the glowing upper blue, with huge dazzling clouds
moving, like herds of white elephants pasturing across
heavenly fields, too slowly for the eye to note their
motion; and below, the far-reaching, tremulous sheen
of reed and bulrush, the wet lair of serpent, wild-cat,
and alligator. Now and then there was the cool blue
of sunny, wind-swept waters winding hither and thither
toward the sea, and sometimes miles of deep forest
swamp through which the railroad went by broad,
frowzy, treeless clearings flanked with impassable
oozy ditches; but shade there was none.</p>

<p>Nor was there peace. Always as he strode along,
something he could not outgo was at his side, gaunt,
wounded, soiled, whispering: &ldquo;Turn back; turn back,
and settle with me,&rdquo; and ever put off with promises&mdash;after
that fashion as old as the world&mdash;to do no end
of good things if only the one right thing might be left
undone.</p>

<p>And so because there were no shade, no peace, and
no turning back, no one day&rsquo;s march made him stronger
for the next; and at length, when he came to the low
thatch of a negro-cabin, under the shadow of its bananas
he sank down in its doorway, red with fever.</p>

<p>There he had to stay many days; but in the end he
was up and on his way again. He left the Atchafalaya
behind him. It was easier going now. There was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
shade. Under his trudging feet was the wagon-road
along the farther levee of the Teche. Above him great
live-oaks stretched their arms clad in green vestments
and gray drapings, the bright sugar-cane fields were on
his left, and on his right the beautiful winding bayou.
In his face, not joy, only pallid eagerness, desire fixed
upon fulfilment, and knowledge that happiness was
something else; a young, worn face, with hard lines
about the mouth and neck; the face of one who had
thought self to be dead and buried, and had seen it
rise to life again, and fallen captive to it. So he was
drawing near to Carancro. Make haste, Bonaventure!</p>

<h3><a name="PART_I_CHAP_IX" id="PART_I_CHAP_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX.</h3>

<h3>THE WEDDING.</h3>


<p>A horse and buggy have this moment been stopped
and are standing on a faint rise of ground seven miles
out beyond the south-western outskirt of Carancro.
The two male occupants of the vehicle are lifting their
heads, and looking with well-pleased faces at something
out over the plain. You know the cur&eacute;?&mdash;and
the ex-governor.</p>

<p>In the far distance, across the vast level, something
that looks hardly so large on the plain as an ant on the
floor, is moving this way across it. This is what the
cur&eacute; and his friend are watching. Open in the cur&eacute;&rsquo;s
hand, as if he had just read it aloud again, is that last
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
letter of Bonaventure&rsquo;s, sent ahead of him from New
Orleans and received some days ago. The governor
holds the reins.</p>

<p>What do they see? Some traveller afoot? Can it
be that Bonaventure is in sight? That is not even the
direction from which Bonaventure, when he comes,
will appear. No, speck though it is, the object they
are looking at is far larger than a man afoot, or any
horse, or horse and cal&egrave;che. It is a house. It is on
wheels, and is drawn by many yoke of oxen. From
what the cur&eacute; is saying we gather that Sosth&egrave;ne has
bought this very small dwelling from a neighbor, and
is moving it to land of his own. Two great beams
have been drawn under the sills at each end, the running
gear of two heavy ox-wagons is made to bear up
the four ends of these beams, all is lashed firmly into
place, the oxen are slowly pulling, the long whips are
cracking, the house is answering the gentle traction,
and, already several miles away from its first site, it
will to-morrow settle down upon new foundations, a
homely type of one whose wreath will soon be a-making,
and who will soon after come to be the little
house&rsquo;s mistress.</p>

<p>But what have we done&mdash;let time slip backward?
A little; not much; for just then, as the ex-governor
said, &ldquo;And where is Bonaventure by this time?&rdquo;
Bonaventure had been only an hour or two in the
negro-cabin where fever had dragged him down.</p>

<p>Since then the house had not only settled safely upon
its new foundations, but Sosth&egrave;ne, in the good, thorough
way that was his own, had carried renovation to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
a point that made the cottage to all intents and purposes
a new house. And the cur&eacute; had looked upon it
again, much nearer by; for before a bride dared enter
a house so nearly new, it had been deemed necessary
for him to come and, before a temporary altar within
the dwelling, to say mass in the time of full moon.
But not yet was the house really a dwelling; it, and
all Carancro, were waiting for the wedding. Make
haste, Bonaventure!</p>

<p>He had left the Teche behind him on the east. And
now a day breaks whose sunset finds him beyond the
Vermilion River. He cannot go aside to the ex-governor&rsquo;s,
over yonder on the right. He is making haste.
This day his journey will end. His heart is light; he
has thought out the whole matter now; he makes no
doubt any longer that the story told him is true. And
he knows now just what to do: this very sunset he
will reach his goal; he goes to fill &rsquo;Thanase&rsquo;s voided
place; to lay his own filial service at the feet of the
widowed mother; to be a brother in the lost brother&rsquo;s
place; and Zos&eacute;phine?&mdash;why, she shall be her daughter,
the same as though &rsquo;Thanase, not he, had won her.
And thus, too, Zos&eacute;phine shall have her own sweet
preference&mdash;that preference which she had so often
whispered to him&mdash;for a scholar rather than a soldier.
Such is the plan, and Conscience has given her
consent.</p>

<p>The sun soars far overhead. It, too, makes haste.
But the wasted, flushed, hungry-eyed traveller is putting
the miles behind him. He questions none to-day that
pass him or whom he overtakes; only bows, wipes his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
warm brow, and presses on across the prairie. Straight
before him, though still far away, a small, white, wooden
steeple rises from out a tuft of trees. It is <i>la chapelle</i>!</p>

<p>The distance gets less and less. See! the afternoon
sunlight strikes the roofs of a few unpainted cottages
that have begun to show themselves at right and left
of the chapel. And now he sees the green window-shutters
of such as are not without them, and their
copperas or indigo-dyed curtains blowing in and out.
Nearer; nearer; here is a house, and yonder another,
newly built. Carancro is reached.</p>

<p>He enters a turfy, cattle-haunted lane between rose-hedges.
In a garden on one side, and presently in
another over the way, children whom he remembers&mdash;but
grown like weeds since he saw them last&mdash;are at
play; but when they stop and gaze at him, it is without
a sign of recognition. Now he walks down the
village street. How empty it seems! was it really
always so? Still, yonder is a man he knows&mdash;and
yonder a woman&mdash;but they disappear without seeing
him.</p>

<p>How familiar every thing is! There are the two
shops abreast of the chapel, Marx&rsquo;s on this side,
Lichtenstein&rsquo;s on that, their dingy false fronts covered
with their same old huge rain-faded words of promise.
Yonder, too, behind the blacksmith&rsquo;s shop, is the little
schoolhouse, dirty, half-ruined, and closed&mdash;that is,
wide-open and empty&mdash;it may be for lack of a teacher,
or funds, or even of scholars.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It shall not be so,&rdquo; said the traveller to himself,
&ldquo;when <em>she</em> and I&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
His steps grow slow. Yet here, not twenty paces
before him, is the home of the cur&eacute;. Ah! that is just
the trouble. Shall he go here first? May he not push
on and out once more upon the prairie and make himself
known first of all to <em>her</em>? Stopping here first, will
not the cur&eacute; say tarry till to-morrow? His steps grow
slower still.</p>

<p>And see, now. One of the Jews in the shop across
the street has observed him. Now two stand together
and scrutinize him; and now there are three, looking
and smiling. Plainly, they recognize him. One starts
to come across, but on that instant the quiet of the
hamlet is broken by a sound of galloping hoofs.</p>

<p>Bonaventure stands still. How sudden is this
change! He is not noticed now; every thing is in
the highest animation. There are loud calls and outcries;
children are shouting and running, and women&rsquo;s
heads are thrust out of doors and windows. Horsemen
come dashing into the village around through the
lanes and up the street. Look! they wheel, they rein
up, they throw themselves from the rattling saddles;
they leave the big wooden stirrups swinging and the
little unkempt ponies shaking themselves, and rush into
the <i>boutique de</i> Monsieur Lichtenstein, and are talking
like mad and decking themselves out on hats and
shoulders with ribbons in all colors of the rainbow!</p>

<p>Suddenly they shout, all together, in answer to a
shout outside. More horsemen appear. Lichtenstein&rsquo;s
store belches all its population.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>La cal&eacute;ge! La cal&eacute;ge!</i>&rdquo; The cal&egrave;che is coming!</p>

<p>Something, he knows not what, makes Bonaventure
tremble.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
&ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; he says in French to a chattering
woman who has just run out of her door, and is
standing near him tying a red Madras kerchief on her
head as she prattles to a girl,&mdash;&ldquo;madame, what
wedding is this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>C&rsquo;est la noce &agrave;</i> Zos&eacute;phine,&rdquo; she replies, without
looking at him, and goes straight on telling her companion
how fifty dollars has been paid for the Pope&rsquo;s
dispensation, because the bridal pair are first cousins.</p>

<p>Bonaventure moves back and leans against a paling
fence, pallid and faint. But there is no time to notice
him&mdash;look, look!</p>

<p>Some women on horseback come trotting into the
street. Cheers! cheers! and in a moment louder
cheers yet&mdash;the cal&egrave;che with the bride and groom
and another with the parents have come.</p>

<p>Throw open the church door!</p>

<p>Horsemen alight, horsewomen descend; down, also,
come they that were in the cal&egrave;che. Look, Bonaventure!
They form by twos&mdash;forward&mdash;in they go.
&ldquo;Hats off, gentlemen! Don&rsquo;t forget the rule!&mdash;Now&mdash;silence!
softly, softly; speak low&mdash;or speak
not at all; sh-sh! Silence! The pair are kneeling.
Hush-sh! Frown down that little buzz about the
door! Sh-sh!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bonaventure has rushed in with the crowd. He
cannot see the kneeling pair; but there is the cur&eacute;
standing over them and performing the holy rite. The
priest stops&mdash;he has seen Bonaventure! He stammers,
and then he goes on. Here beside Bonaventure
is a girl so absorbed in the scene that she thinks
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
she is speaking to her brother, when presently she
says to the haggard young stranger, letting herself
down from her tiptoes and drawing a long breath:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>La sarimonie est fait.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is true; the ceremony is ended. She rises on
tiptoe again to see the new couple sign the papers.</p>

<p>Slowly! The bridegroom first, his mark. Step back.
Now the little bride&mdash;steady! Zos&eacute;phine, <i>sa marque</i>.
She turns; see her, everybody; see her! brown and
pretty as a doe! They are kissing her. Hail, Madame
&rsquo;Thanase!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make way, make way!&rdquo; The man and wife
come forth.&mdash;Ah! &rsquo;Thanase Beausoleil, so tall and
strong, so happy and hale, you do not look to-day like
the poor decoyed, drugged victim that woke up one
morning out in the Gulf of Mexico to find yourself,
without fore-intent or knowledge, one of a ship&rsquo;s
crew bound for Brazil and thence to the Mediterranean!&mdash;&ldquo;Make
way, make way!&rdquo; They mount the
cal&egrave;ches, Sosth&egrave;ne after Madame Sosth&egrave;ne; &rsquo;Thanase
after Madame &rsquo;Thanase. &ldquo;To horse, ladies and gentlemen!&rdquo;
Never mind now about the youth who has
been taken ill in the chapel, and whom the cur&eacute; has
borne almost bodily in his arms to his own house.
&ldquo;Mount! Mount! Move aside for the wedding
singers!&rdquo;&mdash;The wedding singers take their places,
one on this side the bridal cal&egrave;che, the other on that,
and away it starts, creaking and groaning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Mais, arretez!</i>&mdash;Stop, stop! Before going, <i>passez
le &rsquo;nisette</i>!&mdash;pass the anisette!&rdquo; May the New-Orleans
compounder be forgiven the iniquitous
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
mixture! &ldquo;<i>Boir les dames avant!</i>&mdash;Let the ladies drink
first!&rdquo; Aham! straight from the bottle.</p>

<p>Now, go. The cal&egrave;che moves. Other cal&egrave;ches
bearing parental and grandparental couples follow.
And now the young men and maidens gallop after;
the cavalcade stretches out like the afternoon shadows,
and with shout and song and waving of hats and kerchiefs,
away they go! while from window and door
and village street follows the wedding cry:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Adjieu, la cal&eacute;ge! Adjieu, la cal&eacute;ge!</i>&mdash;God speed
the wedding pair!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Coming at first from the villagers, it is continued at
length, faint and far, by the attending cavaliers. As
mile by mile they drop aside, singly or in pairs, toward
their homes, they rise in their stirrups, and lifting high
their ribbon-decked hats, they shout and curvette and
curvette and shout until the eye loses them, and the
ear can barely catch the faint farewell:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Adjieu, la cal&eacute;ge! Adjieu, les mari&eacute;es!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<h3><a name="PART_I_CHAP_X" id="PART_I_CHAP_X"></a>CHAPTER X.</h3>

<h3>AFTER ALL.</h3>


<p>Adieu; but only till the fall of night shall bring
the wedding ball.</p>

<p>One little tune&mdash;and every Acadian fiddler in
Louisiana knows it&mdash;always brings back to Zos&eacute;phine
the opening scene of that festive and jocund convocation.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
She sees again the great clean-swept seed-cotton
room of a cotton-gin house belonging to a cousin of
the ex-governor, lighted with many candles stuck into
a perfect wealth of black bottles ranged along the
beams of the walls. The fiddler&rsquo;s seat is mounted on
a table in the corner, the fiddler is in it, each beau has
led a maiden into the floor, the sets are made for the
contra-dance, the young men stand expectant, their
partners wait with downcast eyes and mute lips as
Acadian damsels should, the music strikes up, and
away they go.</p>

<p>Yes, Zos&eacute;phine sees the whole bright scene over again
whenever that strain sounds.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">

<p class="center" style="font-size: small;">[<a href="music/bonaventure.midi">Listen.</a>]<br />
[<a href="music/bonaventure.pdf">View manuscript as .pdf.</a>]</p>

<p>It was fine from first to last! The ball closed with
the bride&rsquo;s dance. Many a daughter Madame Sosth&egrave;ne
had waltzed that farewell measure with, and now
Zos&eacute;phine was the last. So they danced it, they two,
all the crowd looking on: the one so young and lost
in self, the other so full of years and lost to self;
eddying round and round each other in this last bright
embrace before they part, the mother to swing back
into still water, the child to enter the current of a new
life.</p>

<p>And then came the wedding supper! At one end of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
the long table the bride and groom sat side by side,
and at their left and right the wedding singers stood
and sang. In each corner of the room there was a
barrel of roasted sweet potatoes. How everybody ate,
that night! Rice! beef-balls! pass them here! pass
them there! help yourself! reach them with a fork!
<i>des riz! des boulettes!</i> more down this way! pass them
over heads! <i>des riz! des boulettes!</i> And the anisette!&mdash;bad
whiskey and oil of anise&mdash;never mind that;
pour, fill, empty, fill again! Don&rsquo;t take too much&mdash;and
make sure not to take too little! How merrily all
went on! How gay was Zos&eacute;phine!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does she know that Bonaventure, too, has come
back?&rdquo; the young maidens whisper, one to another;
for the news was afloat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, of course; some one had to let it slip.
But if it makes any difference, she is only brighter
and prettier than before. I tell you&mdash;it seems strange,
but I believe, now, she never cared for anybody but
&rsquo;Thanase. When she heard Bonaventure had come
back, she only let one little flash out of her eyes at the
fool who told her, then said it was the best news that
could be, and has been as serene as the picture of a
saint ever since.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The serenity of the bride might have been less perfect,
and the one flash of her eyes might have been
two, had she known what the cur&eacute; was that minute
saying to the returned wanderer, with the youth&rsquo;s head
pressed upon his bosom, in the seclusion of his own
chamber:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is all for the best, Bonaventure. It is not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
possible that thou shouldst see it so now, but thou shalt
hereafter. It is best this way.&rdquo; And the tears rolled
silently down his cheek as the weary head in his
bosom murmured back:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is best. It is best.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The cur&eacute; could only press him closer then. It was
much more than a year afterward when he for the first
time ventured to add:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never wanted you to get her, my dear boy; she
is not your kind at all&mdash;nay, now, let me say it, since
I have kept it unsaid so long and patiently. Do you
imagine she could ever understand an unselfish life,
or even one that tried to be unselfish? She makes
an excellent Madame &rsquo;Thanase. &rsquo;Thanase is a good,
vigorous, faithful, gentle animal, that knows how to
graze and lie in the shade and get up and graze again.
But you&mdash;it is not in you to know how poor a Madame
Bonaventure she would have been; not now merely,
but poorer and poorer as the years go by.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so I say, do not go away. I know why you
want to go; you want to run away from a haunting
thought that some unlikely accident or other may leave
Madame &rsquo;Thanase a widow, and you step into his big
shoes. They would not fit. Do not go. That thing
is not going to happen; and the way to get rid of the
troublesome notion is to stay and see yourself outgrow
it&mdash;and her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bonaventure shook his head mournfully, but staid.
From time to time Madame &rsquo;Thanase passed before
his view in pursuit of her outdoor and indoor cares.
But even when he came under her gal&eacute;rie roof he could
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
see that she never doubted she had made the very best
choice in all Carancro.</p>

<p>And yet people knew&mdash;she knew&mdash;that Bonaventure
not only enjoyed the acquaintance, but sometimes
actually went from one place to another on the business,
of the great ex-governor. Small matters they may
have been, but, anyhow, just think!</p>

<p>Sometimes as he so went or came he saw her squatting
on a board at the edge of a <i>cool&eacute;e</i>, her petticoat
wrapped snugly around her limbs, and a limp sunbonnet
hiding her nut-brown face, pounding her washing
with a wooden paddle. She was her own housekeeper,
chambermaid, cook, washerwoman, gooseherd, seamstress,
nurse, and all the rest. Her floors, they said,
were always <i>bien fourbis</i> (well scrubbed); her beds
were high, soft, snug, and covered with the white mesh
of her own crochet-needle.</p>

<p>He saw her the oftener because she worked much out
on her low veranda. From that place she had a broad
outlook upon the world, with &rsquo;Thanase in the foreground,
at his toil, sometimes at his sport. His cares
as a herder, <i>vacheur</i>,&mdash;<i>vach&eacute;</i>, he called it,&mdash;were
wherever his slender-horned herds might roam or his
stallions lead their mares in search of the sweetest
herbage; and when rains filled the <i>maraises</i>, and the
cold nor&rsquo;westers blew from Texas and the sod was
spongy with much water, and he went out for feathered
game, the numberless mallards, black ducks, gray
ducks, teal&mdash;with sometimes the canvas-back&mdash;and
the <i>poules-d&rsquo;eau</i>&mdash;the water-hens and the rails, and the
<i>cache-cache</i>&mdash;the snipe&mdash;were as likely to settle or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
rise just before his own house as elsewhere, and the
most devastating shot that hurtled through those
feathered multitudes was that sent by her husband&mdash;hers&mdash;her
own&mdash;possessive case&mdash;belonging to her.
She was proud of her property.</p>

<p>Sometimes <i>la vieille</i>&mdash;for she was <i>la vieille</i> from
the very day that she counted her wedding presents,
mostly chickens, and turned them loose in the dooryard&mdash;sometimes
she enjoyed the fine excitement of seeing
her <i>vieux</i> catching and branding his yearling colts.
Small but not uncomely they were: tougher, stronger,
better when broken, than the mustang, though, like
the mustang, begotten and foaled on the open prairie.
Often she saw him catch two for the plough in the
morning, turn them loose at noon to find their own
food and drink, and catch and work another pair
through the afternoon. So what did not give her
pride gave her quiet comfort. Sometimes she looked
forth with an anxious eye, when a colt was to be
broken for the saddle; for as its legs were untied, and
it sprang to its feet with &rsquo;Thanase in the saddle, and
the blindfold was removed from its eyes, the strain on
the young wife&rsquo;s nerves was as much as was good, to
see the creature&rsquo;s tremendous leaps in air and not
tremble for its superb, unmovable rider.</p>

<p>Could scholarship be finer than&mdash;or as fine as&mdash;such
horsemanship? And yet, somehow, as time ran on,
Zos&eacute;phine, like all the rest of Carancro, began to look
up with a certain deference, half-conscious, half-unconscious,
to the needy young man who was nobody&rsquo;s
love or lover, and yet, in a gentle, unimpassioned
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
way, everybody&rsquo;s; landless, penniless, artless Bonaventure,
who honestly thought there was no girl in
Carancro who was not much too good for him, and of
whom there was not one who did not think him much
too good for her. He was quite outside of all their
gossip. How could they know that with all his learning&mdash;for
he could read and write in two languages
and took the Vermilionville newspaper&mdash;and with all
his books, almost an entire mantel-shelf full&mdash;he was
feeling heart-hunger the same as any ordinary lad or
lass unmated? Zos&eacute;phine found her eyes, so to speak,
lifting, lifting, more and more as from time to time she
looked upon the inoffensive Bonaventure. But so her
satisfaction in her own husband was all the more emphatic.
If she had ever caught a real impulse toward
any thing that even Carancro would have called culture,
she had cast it aside now&mdash;as to herself; her children&mdash;oh!
yes; but that would be by and by.</p>

<p>Even of pastimes and sports she saw almost none.
For &rsquo;Thanase there was, first of all, his fiddle; then
<i>la chasse</i>, the chase; the <i>papegaie</i>, or, as he called it,
<i>pad-go</i>&mdash;the shooting-match; <i>la galloche</i>, pitch-farthing;
the cock-fight; the five-arpent pony-race; and
too often, also, <i>chin-chin</i>, twenty-five-cent poker, and
the gossip and glass of the roadside &ldquo;store.&rdquo; But for
Madame &rsquo;Thanase there was only a seat against the
wall at the Saturday-night dance, and mass <i>&agrave; la chapelle</i>
once in two or three weeks; these, and infant
baptisms. These showed how fast time and life were
hurrying along. The wedding seemed but yesterday,
and yet here was little Sosth&egrave;ne, and tiny Marguerite,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
and cooing Zos&eacute;phine the younger&mdash;how fast history
repeats itself!</p>

<p>But one day, one Sunday, it repeated itself in a
different way. &rsquo;Thanase was in gay humor that morning.
He kissed his wife, tossed his children, played
on his fiddle that tune they all liked best, and, while
Zos&eacute;phine looked after him with young zest in her eye,
sprang into the saddle and galloped across the prairie
<i>&agrave; la chapelle</i> to pass a jolly forenoon at <i>chin-chin</i> in the
village grocery.</p>

<p>Since the war almost every one went armed&mdash;not
for attack, of course; for defence. &rsquo;Thanase was an
exception.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My fists,&rdquo; he said, in the good old drawling
Acadian dialect and with his accustomed smile,&mdash;&ldquo;my
fists will take care of me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One of the party that made up the game with
&rsquo;Thanase was the fellow whom you may remember as
having brought that first news of &rsquo;Thanase from camp
to Carancro, and whom Zos&eacute;phine had discredited.
The young husband had never liked him since.</p>

<p>But, as I say, &rsquo;Thanase was in high spirits. His
jests came thick and fast, and some were hard and
personal, and some were barbed with truth, and one,
at length, ended in the word &ldquo;deserter.&rdquo; The victim
grew instantly fierce and red, leaped up crying &ldquo;Liar,&rdquo;
and was knocked backward to the ground by the long-reaching
fist of &rsquo;Thanase. He rose again and dashed
at his assailant. The rest of the company hastily
made way to right and left, chairs were overturned,
over went the table, the cards were underfoot. Men
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
ran in from outside and from over the way. The two
foes clash together, &rsquo;Thanase smites again with his
fist, and the other grapples. They tug and strain&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Separate them!&rdquo; cry two or three of the packed
crowd in suppressed earnestness. &ldquo;Separate them!
Bonaventure is coming! And here from the other side
the cur&eacute; too! Oh, get them apart!&rdquo; But the half-hearted
interference is shaken off. &rsquo;Thanase sees
Bonaventure and the cur&eacute; enter; mortification smites
him; a smothered cry of rage bursts from his lips; he
tries to hurl his antagonist from him; and just as the
two friends reach out to lay hands upon the wrestling
mass, it goes with a great thud to the ground. The
crowd recoils and springs back again; then a cry of
amazement and horror from all around, the arm of the
under man lifted out over the back of the other, a
downward flash of steel&mdash;another&mdash;and another! the
long, subsiding wail of a strong man&rsquo;s sudden despair,
the voice of one crying,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Zos&eacute;phine! Ah! Zos&eacute;phine! <i>ma vieille! ma
vieille!</i>&rdquo;&mdash;one long moan and sigh, and the finest
horseman, the sweetest musician, the bravest soldier,
yes, and the best husband, in all Carancro, was dead.</p>

<p>Poor old Sosth&egrave;ne and his wife! How hard they
tried, for days, for weeks, to comfort their widowed
child! But in vain. Day and night she put them
away in fierce grief and silence, or if she spoke wailed
always the one implacable answer,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want my husband!&rdquo; And to the cur&eacute; the same
words,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go tell God I want my husband!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
But when at last came one who, having come to
speak, could only hold her hand in his and silently
weep with her, she clung to his with both her own, and
looking up into his young, thin face, cried,&mdash;not with
grace of words, and yet with some grace in all her
words&rsquo; Acadian ruggedness,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bonaventure! Ah! Bonaventure! thou who
knowest the way&mdash;teach me, my brother, how to be
patient.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so&mdash;though the ex-governor had just offered
him a mission in another part of the Acadians&rsquo; land,
a mission, as he thought, far beyond his deserving,
though, in fact, so humble that to tell you what it was
would force your smile&mdash;he staid.</p>

<p>A year went by, and then another. Zos&eacute;phine no
longer lifted to heaven a mutinous and aggrieved
countenance. Bonaventure was often nigh, and his
words were a deep comfort. Yet often, too, her spirit
flashed impatience through her eyes when in the childish
philosophizing of which he was so fond he put forward&mdash;though
ever so impersonally and counting himself
least of all to have attained&mdash;the precepts of self-conquest
and abnegation. And then as the flash passed
away, with a moisture of the eye repudiated by the
pride of the lip, she would slowly shake her head and
say:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is of no use; I can&rsquo;t do it! I may be too
young&mdash;I may be too bad, but&mdash;I can&rsquo;t learn it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At last, one September evening, Bonaventure stood
at the edge of Sosth&egrave;ne&rsquo;s gal&eacute;rie, whither Zos&eacute;phine
had followed out, leaving <i>le vieux</i> and <i>la vieille</i> in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
house. On the morrow Bonaventure was to leave
Carancro. And now he said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Zos&eacute;phine, I must go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, Bonaventure!&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;my children&mdash;what
will my children do? It is not only that you
have taught them to spell and read, though God will
be good to you for that! But these two years you
have been every thing to them&mdash;every thing. They
will be orphaned over again, Bonaventure.&rdquo; Tears
shone in her eyes, and she turned away her face with
her dropped hands clasped together.</p>

<p>The young man laid his hand upon her drooping
brow. She turned again and lifted her eyes to his.
His lips moved silently, but she read upon them the
unheard utterance: it was a word of blessing and farewell.
Slowly and tenderly she drew down his hand,
laid a kiss upon it, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Adjieu&mdash;adjieu</i>,&rdquo; and they parted.</p>

<p>As Zos&eacute;phine, with erect form and firm, clear tread,
went by her parents and into the inner room where her
children lay in their trundle-bed, the old mother said
to <i>le vieux</i>,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can go ahead and repair the schoolhouse now.
Our daughter will want to begin, even to-morrow, to
teach the children of the village&mdash;<i>les zonfants &agrave; la
chapelle</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You think so?&rdquo; said Sosth&egrave;ne, but not as if he
doubted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; it is certain now that Zos&eacute;phine will always
remain the Widow &rsquo;Thanase.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 style="padding-top: 3em;">CHAPTER I.</h3>

<h3>A STRANGER.</h3>


<p>From College Point to Bell&rsquo;s Point, sixty miles
above New Orleans, the Mississippi runs nearly from
west to east. Both banks, or &ldquo;coasts,&rdquo; are lined with
large and famous sugar-plantations. Midway on the
northern side, lie the beautiful estates of &ldquo;Belmont&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Belle Alliance.&rdquo; Early one morning in the
middle of October, 1878, a young man, whose age you
would have guessed fifteen years too much, stood in
scrupulously clean, ill-fitting, flimsy garments, on the
strong, high levee overlooking these two plantations.
He was asking the way to a place called Grande Pointe.
Grand Point, he called it, and so may we: many
names in Louisiana that retain the French spelling are
habitually given an English pronunciation.</p>

<p>A tattered negro mounted on a sunburnt, unshod,
bare-backed mule, down in the dusty gray road on the
land-side of the embankment, was his only hearer.
Fifteen years earlier these two men, with French accents,
strangers to each other, would hardly have conversed
in English; but the date made the difference.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
We need not inexorably render the dialect of the white
man; pretty enough to hear, it would often be hideous
to print. The letter <em>r</em>, for instance, that plague of all
nations&mdash;before consonants it disappeared; before
vowels the tongue failed of that upward curve that
makes the good strong <em>r</em>&rsquo;s of Italy and Great Britain.</p>

<p>The negro pointed over his mule&rsquo;s ears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see Belle Alliance sugah-house yondeh?
Well, behine dah you fine one road go stret thoo the
plantation till de wood. Dass &rsquo;bout mile, you know.
Den she keep stret on thoo de wood &rsquo;bout two mile&rsquo;
mo&rsquo;, an&rsquo; dat fetch you at Gran&rsquo; Point&rsquo;. Hole on;
I show you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two men started down the road, the negro on
his mule, the stranger along the levee&rsquo;s crown.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dat Gran&rsquo; Point&rsquo;,&rdquo; resumed the black; &ldquo;&rsquo;tain&rsquo;t
no point on de riveh, you know, like dat Bell&rsquo; Point,
w&rsquo;at you see yondeh &rsquo;twixt dem ah batture willows

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis the reason I go,&rdquo; said the other, without
looking up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, seh.&rdquo;&mdash;A short silence.&mdash;&ldquo;Dass nigh fifty

<i>C&ocirc;te Acadien&rsquo;</i>, right yeh whar yo&rsquo; feet stan&rsquo;in&rsquo; on.
<i>C&rsquo;est la c&ocirc;te Acadien&rsquo;, just ici, oui.</i>&rdquo; The trudging
stranger waived away the right of translation. He had
some reason for preferring English. But his manner
was very gentle, and in a moment the negro began
again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gret place, dat Gran&rsquo; Point&rsquo;. Yes, seh; fo&rsquo;

grave; yes, seh.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
The gentle stranger interrupted, still without lifting
his eyes from the path. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis better narrowness of
land than of virtue.&rdquo; The negro responded eagerly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dey good sawt o&rsquo; peop&rsquo;, yes. Dey deals fair
an&rsquo; dey deals square. Dey keeps de peace. Dass
&rsquo;caze dey mos&rsquo;ly don&rsquo;t let whisky git on deir blin&rsquo; side,

I don&rsquo;t see fo&rsquo; why folks talk &rsquo;gin dem Cajun&rsquo;; on&rsquo;y
dey a lil bit slow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The traveller on the levee&rsquo;s top suddenly stood still,
a soft glow on his cheek, a distension in his blue eyes.
&ldquo;My friend, what was it, the first American industry?
Was it not the Newfoundland fisheries? Who inaugu&rsquo;ate
them, if not the fishermen of Normandy and
Bretagne? And since how long? Nearly fo&rsquo; hundred
years!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dass so, boss,&rdquo; exclaimed the negro with the
promptitude of an eye-witness; but the stranger continued:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The ancestors of the Acadian&rsquo;&mdash;they are the
fathers of the codfish!&rdquo; He resumed his walk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dass so, seh; dass true. Yes, seh, you&rsquo; talkin&rsquo;

<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<h3><a name="PART_II_CHAP_II" id="PART_II_CHAP_II"></a>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<h3>IN A STRANGE LAND.</h3>


<p>An hour later the stranger, quite alone, had left
behind him the broad smooth road, between rustling
walls of sugar-cane, that had brought him through
Belle Alliance plantation. The way before him was
little more than a bridle-path along the earth thrown
up beside a draining-ditch in a dense swamp. The
eye could run but a little way ere it was confused by
the tangle of vegetation. The trees of the all-surrounding
forest&mdash;sweet-gums, water-oaks, magnolias&mdash;cast
their shade obliquely along and across his way, and
wherever it fell the undried dew still sparkled on the
long grass.</p>

<p>A pervading whisper seemed to say good-by to the
great human world. Scarce the note of an insect
joined with his footsteps in the coarse herbage to break
the stillness. He made no haste. Ferns were often
about his feet, and vines were both there and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
everywhere. The soft blue tufts of the ageratum were on
each side continually. Here and there in wet places
clumps of Indian-shot spread their pale scroll leaves
and sent up their green and scarlet spikes. Of stature
greater than his own the golden-rod stood, crested with
yellow plumes, unswayed by the still air. Often he
had to push apart the brake-canes and press through
with bowed head. Nothing met him in the path. Now
and then there were faint signs underfoot as if wheels
might have crushed the ragged turf long weeks before.
Now and then the print of a hoof was seen in the
black soil, but a spider had made it her home and
spread across it her silken snares. If he halted and
hearkened, he heard far away the hawk screaming to
his mate, and maybe, looking up, caught a glimpse of
him sailing in the upper air with the sunlight glowing
in his pinions; or in some bush near by heard the soft
rustle of the wren, or the ruffling whiff and nervous
&ldquo;chip&rdquo; of the cardinal, or saw for an instant the flirt
of his crimson robes as he rattled the stiff, jagged fans
of the palmetto.</p>

<p>At length the path grew easier and lighter, the woods
on the right gave place to a field half claimed for
cotton and half given up to persimmon saplings, blackberry-bushes,
and rampant weeds. A furry pony with
mane and tail so loaded with cockleburs that he could
not shake them, lifted his head and stared. A moment
afterward the view opened to right and left, and the
path struck a grassy road at right angles and ended.
Just there stood an aged sow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unclean one,&rdquo; said the grave wayfarer, &ldquo;where
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
dwells your master?&mdash;Ignore you the English tongue?
But I shall speak not in another; &rsquo;tis that same that I
am arriving to bring you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The brute, with her small bestial eye fixed on him
distrustfully and askance, moved enough to the right
to let him pass on the other hand, and with his coat on
his arm&mdash;so strong was the October sun&mdash;he turned
into the road westward, followed one or two of its
slight curves, and presently saw neat fields on either
hand, walled in on each farther side by the moss-hung
swamp; and now a small, gray, unpainted house, then
two or three more, the roofs of others peering out over
the dense verdure, and down at the end of the vista a
small white spire and cross. Then, at another angle,
two men seated on the roadside. Their diffident gaze
bore that look of wild innocence that belongs to those
who see more of dumb nature than of men. Their
dress was homespun. The older was about fifty years
old, the other much younger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sirs, have I already reach Gran&rsquo; Point&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The older replied in an affirmative that could but
just be heard, laid back a long lock of his straight
brown hair after the manner of a short-haired girl, and
rose to his feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hunt,&rdquo; said the traveller slowly, &ldquo;Mr. Maximian
Roussel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A silent bow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The same motion again.</p>

<p>The traveller produced a slip of paper folded once
and containing a line or two of writing hastily pencilled
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
that morning at Belle Alliance. Maximian received it
timidly and held it helplessly before his downcast eyes
with the lines turned perpendicularly, while the pause
grew stifling, and until the traveller said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis Mr. Wallis make that introduction.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the name of the owner of the beautiful plantation
the man who had not yet spoken rose, covered
with whittlings. It was like a steer getting up out of
the straw. He spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;M&rsquo;sieu&rsquo; Walleece, <i>a commenc&eacute; &agrave; mouliner</i>? Is big-in
to gryne?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He shall commence in the centre of the next
week.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Maximian&rsquo;s eyes rose slowly from the undeciphered
paper. The traveller&rsquo;s met them. He pointed to the
missive.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The schoolmaster therein alluded&mdash;&rsquo;tis me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried the villager joyously, &ldquo;<i>ma&icirc;tre d&rsquo;&eacute;cole!</i>&mdash;schooltitcher!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said the stranger, &ldquo;not worthy the title.&rdquo;
He accepted gratefully the hand of one and then of
the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Walk een!&rdquo; said Maximian, &ldquo;all hand&rsquo;, walk
een house.&rdquo; They went, Indian file, across the road,
down a sinuous footpath, over a stile, and up to his
little single-story unpainted house, and tramped in
upon the railed gal&eacute;rie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Et</i> M&rsquo;sieu&rsquo; Le Bourgeois,&rdquo; said the host, as the
schoolmaster accepted a split-bottomed chair, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s
big-in to gryne?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Within this ground-floor veranda&mdash;chief appointment
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
of all Acadian homes&mdash;the traveller accepted a
drink of water in a blue tumbler, brought by the meek
wife. The gal&eacute;rie just now was scattered with the
husband&rsquo;s appliances for making P&eacute;rique tobacco into
&ldquo;carats&rdquo;&mdash;the carat-press. Its small, iron-ratcheted,
wooden windlass extended along the top rail of the
balustrade across one of the gal&eacute;rie&rsquo;s ends. Lines of
half-inch grass rope, for wrapping the carats into
diminished bulk and solid shape, lay along under foot.
Beside one of the doors, in deep hickory baskets, were
the parcels of cured tobacco swaddled in cotton cloths
and ready for the torture of ropes and windlass. From
the joists overhead hung the pods of tobacco-seed for
next year&rsquo;s planting.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<h3><a name="PART_II_CHAP_III" id="PART_II_CHAP_III"></a>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<h3>THE HANDSHAKING.</h3>


<p>There was news in Grande Pointe. The fair noon
sky above, with its peaceful flocks of clouds; the
solemn, wet forest round about; the harvested fields;
the dishevelled, fragrant fallows; the reclining, ruminating
cattle; the little chapel of St. Vincent de Paul
in the midst, open for mass once a fortnight, for a
sermon in French four times a year,&mdash;these were not
more tranquil in the face of the fact that a schoolmaster
had come to Grande Pointe to <em>stay</em> than outwardly
appeared the peaceful-minded villagers. Yet as the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
tidings floated among the people, touching and drifting
on like thistle-down, they were stirred within, and came
by ones, by twos, slow-stepping, diffidently smiling, to
shake hands with the young great man. They wiped
their own before offering them&mdash;the men on their
strong thighs, the women on their aprons. Children
came, whose courage would carry them no nearer than
the gal&eacute;rie&rsquo;s end or front edge, where they lurked and
hovered, or gazed through the balustrade, or leaned
against a gal&eacute;rie post and rubbed one brown bare foot
upon another and crowded each other&rsquo;s shoulders without
assignable cause, or lopped down upon the grass
and gazed from a distance.</p>

<p>Little conversation was offered. The curiosity was
as unobtrusive as the diffidence was without fear; and
when a villager&rsquo;s soft, low speech was heard, it was
generally in answer to inquiries necessary for one to
make who was about to assume the high office of educator.
Moreover, the schoolmaster revealed, with all
gentleness, his preference for the English tongue, and
to this many could only give ear. Only two or three
times did the conversation rise to a pitch that kindled
even the ready ardor of the young man of letters.
Once, after a prolonged silence, the host, having gazed
long upon his guest, said, without preface:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tough jawb you got,&rdquo; and waved a hand toward
the hovering children.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; replied the young scholar, &ldquo;is it not the
better to do whilse it is the mo&rsquo; tough? The mo&rsquo;
toughness, the mo&rsquo; honor.&rdquo; He rose suddenly,
brushed back the dry, brown locks of his fine hair, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
extending both hands, with his limp straw hat dangling
in one, said: &ldquo;Sir, I will ask you; is not the
schoolmaster the true patriot? Shall his honor be less
than that of the soldier? Yet I ask not honor; for
me, I am not fit; yet, after my poor capacities&rdquo;&mdash;He
resumed his seat.</p>

<p>An awesome quiet followed. Then some one spoke
to him, too low to be heard. He bent forward to hear
the words repeated, and &rsquo;Mian said for the timorous
speaker:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aw, dass nut&rsquo;n; he jis only say, &lsquo;Is M&rsquo;sieu&rsquo;
Walleece big-in to gryne?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Few tarried long, though one man&mdash;he whom the
schoolmaster had found sitting on the roadside with
Maximian&mdash;staid all day; and even among the villagers
themselves there was almost no loquacity.
Maximian, it is true, as the afternoon wore along,
and it seemed plain that the reception was a great and
spontaneous success, spoke with growing frequency
and heartiness; and, when the guest sat down alone
at a table within, where <i>la vieille</i>&mdash;the wife&mdash;was
placing half-a-dozen still sputtering fried eggs, a great
wheaten loaf, a yellow gallon bowl of boiled milk, a
pewter ladle, a bowie-knife, the blue tumbler, and
a towel; and out on the gal&eacute;rie the callers were still
coming: his simple neighbors pardoned the elation
that led him to take a chair himself a little way off,
sit on it sidewise, cross his legs gayly, and with a
smile and wave of his good brown hand say:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Servez-vous!</i> He&rsquo;p you&rsquo;se&rsquo;f! Eat much you like;
till you swell up!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
Even he asked no questions. Only near the end of
the day, when the barefoot children by gradual ventures
had at length gathered close about and were softly
pushing for place on his knees, and huddling under his
arms, and he was talking French,&mdash;the only language
most of them knew,&mdash;he answered the first personal
inquiry put to him since arriving. &ldquo;His name,&rdquo; he
replied to the tiny, dark, big-eyed boy who spoke for
his whispering fellows, &ldquo;his name was Bonaventure&mdash;Bonaventure
Deschamps.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the great October sun began to dip his crimson
wheel behind the low black line of swamp, and the
chapel cross stood out against a band of yellow light
that spanned the west, he walked out to see the village,
a little girl on either hand and little boys round
about. The children talked apace. Only the girl
whose hand he held in his right was mute. She was
taller than the rest; yet it was she to whom the little
big-eyed boy pointed when he said, vain of his ability
to tell it in English:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t got but eight year&rsquo; old, me. I&rsquo;m gran&rsquo;
for my age; but she, she not gran&rsquo; for her age&mdash;Sidonie;
no; she not gran&rsquo; at all for <em>her</em> age.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They told the story of the chapel: how some years
before, in the Convent of the Sacred Heart, at the
parish seat a few miles away on the Mississippi, a nun
had by the Pope&rsquo;s leave cast off the veil; how she
had come to Grande Pointe and taken charge of her
widowed brother&rsquo;s children; and how he had died, and
she had found means, the children knew not how, to
build this chapel. And now she was buried under it,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
they said. It seemed, from what they left unsaid
as well as what they said, that the simple influence of
her presence had kindled a desire for education in
Grande Pointe not known before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dass my <i>tante</i>&mdash;my hant. She <em>was</em> my hant
befo&rsquo; she die&rsquo;,&rdquo; said the little man of eight years, hopping
along the turf in front of the rest. He dropped
into a walk that looked rapid, facing round and moving
backward. &ldquo;She learn me English, my <i>tante</i>.
And she try to learn Sidonie; but Sidonie, Sidonie
fine that too strong to learn, that English, Sidonie.&rdquo;
He hopped again, talking as he hopped, and holding
the lifted foot in his hand. He could do that and
speak English at the same time, so talented was
Toutou.</p>

<p>Thus the sun went down. And at Maximian&rsquo;s stile
again Bonaventure Deschamps took the children&rsquo;s
cheeks into his slender fingers and kissed them, one by
one, beginning at the least, and so up, slowly, toward
Sidonie Le Blanc. With very earnest tenderness it
was done, some grave word of inspiration going before
each caress; but when at last he said, &ldquo;To-morrow,
dear chil&rsquo;run, the school-bell shall ring in Gran&rsquo;
Point&rsquo;!&rdquo; and turned to finish with Sidonie&mdash;she was
gone.</p>

<h3><a name="PART_II_CHAP_IV" id="PART_II_CHAP_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<h3>HOW THE CHILDREN RANG THE BELL.</h3>


<p>Where the fields go wild and grow into brakes, and
the soil becomes fenny, on the north-western edge of
Grande Pointe, a dark, slender thread of a bayou
moves loiteringly north-eastward into a swamp of huge
cypresses. In there it presently meets another like
itself, the Bayou Tchackchou, slipping around from
the little farm village&rsquo;s eastern end as silently as a
little mother comes out of a bower where she has just
put her babe to sleep. A little farther on they are
joined as noiselessly by Blind River, and the united
waters slip on northward through the dim, colonnaded,
watery-floored, green-roofed, blue-vapored, moss-draped
wilderness, till in the adjoining parish of Ascension
they curve around to the east and issue into
the sunny breadth of Lake Maurepas. Thus they
make the Bayou des Acadiens. From Lake Maurepas
one can go up Amite or Tickfaw River, or to Pass
Manchac or Pontchatoula, anywhere in the world, in
fact,&mdash;where a canoe can go.</p>

<p>On a bank of this bayou, no great way from Grande
Pointe, but with the shadow of the swamp at its back
and a small, bright prairie of rushes and giant reeds
stretching away from the opposite shore, stood, more
in the water than on the land, the palmetto-thatched
fishing and hunting lodge and only home of a man who
on the other side of the Atlantic you would have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
known for a peasant of Normandy, albeit he was born
in this swamp,&mdash;the man who had tarried all day at
the schoolmaster&rsquo;s handshaking.</p>

<p>What a day that had been! Once before he had
witnessed a positive event. That was when, one day,
he journeyed purposely to the levee of Belle Alliance,
waited from morning till evening, and at last saw the
steamer &ldquo;Robert E. Lee&rdquo; come by, and, as fortune
would have it, land! loaded with cotton from the water
to the hurricane deck. He had gone home resolved
from that moment to save his money, and be something
more than he was.</p>

<p>But that event had flashed before his eyes, and in
a quarter-hour was gone, save in his memory. The
coming of the schoolmaster, all unforeseen, had lasted
a day, and he had seen it from beginning to end. All
day long on &rsquo;Mian&rsquo;s gal&eacute;rie, standing now here, now
there, he had got others to interpret for him, where
he could not guess, the meanings of the wise and
noble utterances that fell every now and then from
the lips of the young soldier of learning, and stored
them away in his now greedy mind.</p>

<p>One saying in particular, whose originality he did
not dream of questioning, took profound hold of his
conviction and admiration; and two or three times that
evening, as his canoe glided homeward in the twilight,
its one long, smooth ripple gleaming on this side and
that as it widened away toward the bayou&rsquo;s dark
banks, he rested for a moment on his tireless paddle,
and softly broke the silence of the wilderness with its
three simple words, so trite to our ears, so strange to
his:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
&ldquo;Knowledge is power.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In years he was but thirty-five; but he was a
widower, and the one son who was his only child and
companion would presently be fourteen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Claude,&rdquo; he said, as they rose that evening from
their hard supper in the light and fumes of their small
kerosene-lamp, &ldquo;<i>I&rsquo; faut z-ahler coucher.</i>&rdquo; (We must
go to bed.)</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Quofoir?</i>&rdquo; asked the sturdy lad. (<i>Pourquoi?</i>
Why?)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; replied the father in the same strange
French in which he had begun, &ldquo;at daybreak to-morrow,
and every day thereafter, you must be in your
dug-out on your way to Grande Pointe, to school.
My son, you are going to learn how to read!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So came it that, until their alphabetical re-arrangement,
the first of all the thirty-five names on the roll
was Claude St. Pierre, and that every evening thenceforward
when that small kerosene-lamp glimmered in
the deep darkness of Bayou des Acadiens, the abecedarian
Claude was a teacher.</p>

<p>But even before the first rough roll was made he was
present, under the little chapel-tower, when for the
first time its bell rang for school. The young master
was there, and all the children; so that really there
was nothing to ring the bell for. They could, all together,
have walked quietly across the village green to
the forlorn tobacco-shed that &rsquo;Mian had given them
for a schoolhouse, and begun the session. Ah! say
not so! It was good to ring the bell. A few of
the stronger lads would even have sent the glad clang
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
abroad before the time, but Bonaventure restrained
them. For one thing, there must be room for every
one to bear a hand. So he tied above their best reach
three strands of &ldquo;carat&rdquo; cord to the main rope. Even
then he was not ready.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, dear chil&rsquo;run; but grasp hold, every one, the
ropes, the cawds,&mdash;the shawt chil&rsquo;run reaching up
shawtly, the long chil&rsquo;run the more longly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Few understood his words, but they quietly caught
the idea, and yielded themselves eagerly to his arranging
hand. The highest grasp was Claude&rsquo;s. There
was a little empty space under it, and then one only
of Sidonie&rsquo;s hands, timid, smooth, and brown. And
still the master held back the word.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not yet! not yet! The pear is not ripe!&rdquo; He
stood apart from them, near the chapel-door, where
the light was strong, his silver watch open in his left
hand, his form erect, his right hand lifted to the brim
of his hat, his eyes upon the dial.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not yet, dear chil&rsquo;run. Not yet. Two minute
mo&rsquo;.&mdash;Be ready.&mdash;Not yet!&mdash;One minute mo&rsquo;!&mdash;Have
the patience. Hold every one in his aw her place.
Be ready! Have the patience.&rdquo; But at length when
the little ones were frowning and softly sighing with the
pain of upheld arms, their waiting eyes saw his dilate.
&ldquo;Be ready!&rdquo; he said, with low intensity: &ldquo;Be ready!&rdquo;
He soared to his tiptoes, the hat flounced from his head
and smote his thigh, his eyes turned upon them blazing,
and he cried, &ldquo;Ring, chil&rsquo;run, ring!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The elfin crew leaped up the ropes and came crouching
down. The bell pealed; the master&rsquo;s hat swung
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
round his head. His wide eyes were wet, and he cried
again, &ldquo;Ring! ring! for God, light, libbutty, education!&rdquo;
He sprang toward the leaping, sinking mass;
but the right feeling kept his own hands off. And up
and down the children went, the bell answering from
above, peal upon peal; when just as they had caught
the rhythm of Claude&rsquo;s sturdy pull, and the bell could
sound no louder, the small cords gave way from their
fastenings, the little ones rolled upon their backs, the
bell gave one ecstatic double clang and turned clear
over, the swift rope straightened upward from its coil,
and Claude and Sidonie, her hands clasped upon each
other about the rope and his hands upon hers, shot up
three times as high as their finest leap could have
carried them. For an instant they hung; then with
another peal the bell turned back and they came blushing
to the floor. A swarm of hands darted to the
rope, but Bonaventure&rsquo;s was on it first.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis sufficient!&rdquo; he said, his face all triumph.
The bell gave a lingering clang or two and ceased, and
presently the happy company walked across the green.
&ldquo;Sufficient,&rdquo; the master had said; but it was more
than sufficient. In that moment of suspension, with
Sidonie&rsquo;s great brown frightened eyes in his, and their
four hands clasped together, Claude had learned, for
his first lesson, that knowledge is not the only or the
greatest power.</p>

<h3>INVITED TO LEAVE.</h3>


<p>After that, every school-day morning Claude rang
the bell. Always full early his pirogue came gliding
out of the woods and up through the bushy fen to the
head of canoe navigation and was hauled ashore.
Bonaventure had fixed his home near the chapel and
not far from Claude&rsquo;s landing-place. Thus the lad
could easily come to his door each morning at the
right moment&mdash;reading it by hunter&rsquo;s signs in nature&rsquo;s
book&mdash;to get the word to ring. There were none of
the usual reasons that the schoolmaster should live
close to the schoolhouse. There was no demand for
its key.</p>

<p>Not of that schoolhouse! A hundred feet length
by twenty-five breadth, of earth-floored, clapboard-roofed,
tumbling shed, rudely walled with cypress split
boards,&mdash;<i>pieux</i>,&mdash;planted endwise in the earth, like
palisades, a hand-breadth space between every two,
and sunlight and fresh air and the gleams of green
fields coming in; the scores of little tobacco-presses
that had stood in ranks on the hard earth floor, the
great sapling levers, and the festoons of curing tobacco
that had hung from the joists overhead, all removed,
only the odor left; bold gaps here and there in the
<i>pieux</i>, made by that mild influence which the restless
call decay, and serving for windows and doors; the
eastern end swept clean and occupied by a few benches
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
and five or six desks, strong, home-made, sixty-four
pounders.</p>

<p>Life had broadened with Claude in two directions.
On one side opened, fair and noble, the acquaintanceship
of Bonaventure Deschamps, a man who had seen
the outside world, a man of books, of learning, a man
who could have taught even geography, had there been
any one to learn it; and on the other side, like a garden
of roses and spices, the schoolmateship of Sidonie Le
Blanc. To you and me she would have seemed the
merest little brown sprout of a thing, almost nothing
but two big eyes&mdash;like a little owl. To Claude it
seemed as though nothing older or larger could be so
exactly in the prime of beauty; the path to learning
was the widest, floweriest, fragrantest path he had ever
trod.</p>

<p>Sidonie did not often speak with him. At recess
she usually staid at her desk, studying, quite alone but
for Bonaventure silently busy at his, and Claude himself,
sitting farther away, whenever the teacher did
not see him and drive him to the playground. If he
would only drive Sidonie out! But he never did.</p>

<p>One day, after quite a contest of learning, and as
the hour of dismission was scattering the various
groups across the green, Toutou, the little brother who
was grand for his age, said to Claude, hanging timidly
near Sidonie:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Alle est plus</i> smart&rsquo; <i>que vous</i>.&rdquo; (She is smarter
than you.)</p>

<p>Whereupon Sidonie made haste to say in their Acadian
French, &ldquo;Ah! Master Toutou, you forget we
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
went to school to our dear aunt. And besides, I am
small and look young, but I am nearly a year older
than Claude.&rdquo; She had wanted to be kind, but that
was the first thorn. Older than he!</p>

<p>And not only that; nearly fifteen! Why, at fifteen&mdash;at
fifteen girls get married! The odds were heavy.
He wished he had thought of that at first. He was
sadly confused. Sometimes when Bonaventure spoke
words of enthusiasm and regard to him after urging
him fiercely up some hill of difficulty among the bristling
heights of English pronunciation, he yearned to
seek him alone and tell him this difficulty of the heart.
There was no fear that Bonaventure would laugh; he
seemed scarce to know how; and his smiles were all
of tenderness and zeal. Claude did not believe the
ten years between them would matter; had not Bonaventure
said to him but yesterday that to him all loveliness
was the lovelier for being very young? Yet
when the confession seemed almost on Claude&rsquo;s lips
it was driven back by an alien mood in the master&rsquo;s
face. There were troubles in Bonaventure&rsquo;s heart
that Claude wot not of.</p>

<p>One day who should drop in just as school was about
to begin but the priest from College Point! Such order
as he found! Bonaventure stood at his desk like a
general on a high hill, his large hand-bell in his grasp,
passed his eyes over the seventeen demure girls, with
their large, brown-black, liquid eyes, their delicately
pencilled brows, their dark, waveless hair, and sounded
one tap! The sport outside ceased, the gaps at the
shed&rsquo;s farther end were darkened by small forms that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
came darting like rabbits into their burrows, eighteen
small hats came off, and the eighteen boys came softly
forward and took their seats. Such discipline!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Bonaventure, &ldquo;think you &rsquo;tis arising,
f&rsquo;om the strickness of the teacher? &rsquo;Tis f&rsquo;om the
goodness of the chil&rsquo;run! How I long the State
Sup&rsquo;inten&rsquo;ent Public Education to see them!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The priest commended the sight and the wish with
smiling affirmations that somehow seemed to lack sympathy.
He asked the names of two or three pupils.
That little fellow with soft, tanned, chubby cheeks and
great black eyes, tiny mouth, smooth feet so shapely
and small, still wet to their ankles with dew, and arms
that he could but just get folded, was Toutou. That
lad with the strong shoulders, good wide brows, steady
eye, and general air of manliness,&mdash;that was Claude
St. Pierre. And this girl over on the left here,&mdash;&ldquo;You
observe,&rdquo; said Bonaventure, &ldquo;I situate the
lambs on the left and the kids on the right,&rdquo;&mdash;this
little, slender crescent of human moonlight, with her
hair in two heavy, black, down-falling plaits, meek,
drooping eyes, long lashes, soft childish cheeks and
full throat, was Sidonie Le Blanc. Bonaventure murmured:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Best scholah in the school, yet the <em>only</em>&mdash;that
loves not her teacher. But I give always my interest,
not according to the interestingness, but rather to the
necessitude, of each.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The visit was not long. Standing, about to depart,
the visitor seemed still, as at the first, a man of many
reservations under his polite smiles. But just then he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
dropped a phrase that the teacher recognized as an
indirect quotation, and Bonaventure cried, with greedy
eyes:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have read Victor Hugo?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, sir, that grea-a-at man! That father of libbutty!
Other patriots are the sons, but he the father!
Is it not thus?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The priest shrugged and made a mouth. The young
schoolmaster&rsquo;s face dropped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir, I must ask you&mdash;is he not the frien&rsquo; of the
poor and downtrod?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The visitor&rsquo;s smile quite disappeared. He said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;&mdash;and waved a hand impatiently; &ldquo;Victor
Hugo&rdquo;&mdash;another mouth&mdash;&ldquo;Victor Hugo&rdquo;&mdash;replying
in French to the schoolmaster&rsquo;s English&mdash;&ldquo;is not
of my party.&rdquo; And then he laughed unpleasantly
and said good-day.</p>

<p>The State Superintendent did not come, but every
day&mdash;&ldquo;It is perhaps he shall come to-mo&rsquo;w, chil&rsquo;run;
have yo&rsquo; lessons well!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The whole tiny army of long, blue, ankle-hiding cottonade
pantalettes and pantaloons tried to fulfil the
injunction. Not one but had a warm place in the
teacher&rsquo;s heart. But Toutou, Claude, Sidonie, anybody
who glanced into that heart could see sitting there
enthroned. And some did that kind of reconnoitring.
Catou, &rsquo;Mian&rsquo;s older brother, was much concerned.
He saw no harm in a little education, but took no satisfaction
in the introduction of English speech; and
speaking to &rsquo;Mian of that reminded him to say he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
believed the schoolmaster himself was aware of the
three children&rsquo;s pre-eminence in his heart. But &rsquo;Mian
only said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Ah bien, c&rsquo;est</i> all right, <i>alors</i>!&rdquo; (Well, then, it&rsquo;s
all right.) Whether all right or not, Bonaventure was
aware of it, and tried to hide it under special kindnesses
to others, and particularly to the dullard of the
school, grandson of Catou and nicknamed <i>Cr&eacute;biche</i><a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>.
The child loved him; and when Claude rang the chapel
bell, and before its last tap had thrilled dreamily on
the morning air, when the urchins playing about the
schoolhouse espied another group coming slowly across
the common with Bonaventure in the midst of them,
his coat on his arm and the children&rsquo;s hands in his,
there among them came Cr&eacute;biche, now on one side,
now running round to the other, hoping so to get a
little nearer to the master.</p>

<p>&ldquo;None shall have such kindness to-day as thou,&rdquo;
Bonaventure would silently resolve as he went in
through a gap in the <i>pieux</i>. And the children could
not see but he treated them all alike. They saw no
unjust inequality even when, Cr&eacute;biche having three
times spelt &ldquo;earth&rdquo; with an <em>u</em>, the master paced to
and fro on the bare ground among the unmatched
desks and break-back benches, running his hands
through his hair and crying:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well! well aht thou name&rsquo; the crawfish; with such
rapiditive celeritude dost thou progress backwardly!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It must have been to this utterance that he alluded
when at the close of that day he walked, as he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
supposed, with only birds and grasshoppers for companions,
and they grew still, and the turtle-doves
began to moan, and he smote his breast and cried:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! rules, rules! how easy to make, likewise
break! Oh! the shame, the shame! <em>If</em> Victor Hugo
had seen that! And if George Washington! But
thou,&rdquo;&mdash;some one else, not mentioned,&mdash;&ldquo;thou
sawedst it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The last word was still on the speaker&rsquo;s lips, when&mdash;there
beside the path, with heavy eye and drunken
frown, stood the father of Cr&eacute;biche, the son of Catou,
the little boy of twenty-five known as Chat-ou&eacute;. He
spoke:</p>

<p>&ldquo;To who is dat you speak? Talk wid de dev&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bonaventure murmured a salutation, touched his hat,
and passed. Chat-ou&eacute; moved a little, and delivered a
broadside:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Afteh dat, you betteh leave! Yes, you betteh
leave Gran&rsquo; Point&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Bonaventure, turning with flushed face,
&ldquo;I stay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;dass righ&rsquo;; you betteh go
way and stay. <i>Magicien</i>,&rdquo; he added as the schoolmaster
moved on, &ldquo;<i>sorcier!</i>&mdash;Voudou!&mdash;jackass!&rdquo;</p>

<p>What did all this mean?</p>

<h3><a name="PART_II_CHAP_VI" id="PART_II_CHAP_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<h3>WAR OF DARKNESS AND LIGHT.</h3>


<p>Catou, it seems, had gone one day to College Point
with a pair of wild ducks that he had shot,&mdash;first
of the season,&mdash;and offered them to the priest who
preached for Grande Pointe once a quarter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Catou,&rdquo; said the recipient, in good French but
with a cruel hardness of tone, &ldquo;why does that man
out there teach his school in English?&rdquo; The questioner&rsquo;s
intentions were not unkind. He felt a protector&rsquo;s
care for his Acadian sheep, whose wants he
fancied he, if not he only, understood. He believed
a sudden overdose of enlightenment would be to them
a real disaster, and he proposed to save them from it
by the kind of management they had been accustomed
to&mdash;they and their fathers&mdash;for a thousand years.</p>

<p>Catou answered the question only by a timid smile
and shrug. The questioner spoke again:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you Grande Pointe folk allow it? Do
you want your children stuffed full of American ideas?
What is in those books they are studying? You don&rsquo;t
know? Neither do I. I would not look into one of
them. But you ought to know that to learn English
is to learn free-thinking. Do you know who print
those books that your children are rubbing their noses
in? Yankees! Oh, I doubt not they have been sharp
enough to sprinkle a little of the stuff <em>they</em> call religion
here and there in them; &rsquo;tis but the bait on the hook!
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
But you silly &rsquo;Cadians think your children are getting
education, and that makes up for every thing else.
Do you know what comes of it? Discontent. Vanity.
Contempt of honest labor. Your children are going
to be discontented with their lot. It will soon be
good-by to sunbonnets; good-by to homespun; good-by
to Grande Pointe,&mdash;yes, and good-by to the faith
of your fathers. Catou, what do you know about
that man, anyhow? You ask him no questions, you
&rsquo;Cadians, and he&mdash;oh, he is too modest to tell you who
or what he is. <em>Who pays him?</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He say pay is way behine. He say he don&rsquo;t get
not&rsquo;in&rsquo; since he come yondeh,&rdquo; said Catou, the distress
that had gathered on his face disappearing for
a moment.</p>

<p>The questioner laughed contemptuously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose he works that way for nothing?
How do you know, at all, that his real errand is to
teach school? A letter from Mr. Wallis! who simply
told your simple-minded brother what the fellow told
him! See here, Catou; you owe a tax as a raiser of
tobacco, eh? And besides that, hasn&rsquo;t every one
of you an absurd little sign stuck up on the side of his
house, as required by the Government, to show that
you owe another tax as a tobacco manufacturer? But
still you have a little arrangement to neutralize that,
eh? How do you know this man is not among you to
look into that? Do you know that he <em>can</em> teach? No
wonder he prefers to teach in English! I had a conversation
with him the other day; I want no more; he
preferred to talk to <em>me</em> in English. That is the good
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
manners he is teaching; light-headed, hero-worshipping,
free-thinker that he is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Catou was sore dismayed. He had never heard of
hero-worship or free-thinking before, but did not doubt
their atrocity. It had never occurred to him that a
man with a few spelling-books and elementary readers
could be so dangerous to society.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish he clear out from yondeh,&rdquo; said Catou. He
really made his short responses in French, but in a
French best indicated in bad English.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not for my sake,&rdquo; replied the priest, coldly smiling.
&ldquo;I shall just preach somewhere else on the thirteenth
Sunday of each quarter, and let Grande Pointe
go to the devil; for there is where your new friend
is sure to land you. Good-day, I am very busy this
morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These harsh words&mdash;harsh barking of the shepherd
dog&mdash;spread an unseen consternation in Grande
Pointe. Maximian was not greatly concerned. When
he heard of the threat to cut off the spiritual table-crumbs
with which the villagers had so scantily been
fed, he only responded that in his opinion the dominie
was no such a fool as that. But others could not so
easily dismiss their fears. They began to say privately,
leaning on fences and lingering at stiles, that
they had felt from the very day of that first mad bell-ringing
that the whole movement was too headlong;
that this opening the sluices of English education
would make trouble. Children shouldn&rsquo;t be taught
what their parents do not understand. Not that there
was special harm in a little spelling, adding, or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
subtracting, but&mdash;the notions they and the teacher produced!
Here was the school&rsquo;s influence going through
all the place like the waters of a rising tide. All
Grande Pointe was lifting from the sands, and in danger
of getting afloat and drifting toward the current
of the great world&rsquo;s life. Personally, too, the schoolmaster
seemed harmless enough. From the children
and he loving each other, the hearts of the seniors had
become entangled. The children had come home from
the atmosphere of that old tobacco-shed, and persuaded
the very grandmothers to understand vaguely&mdash;very
vaguely and dimly&mdash;that the day of liberty which had
come to the world at large a hundred years before
had come at last to them; that in France their race
had been peasants; in Acadia, forsaken colonists; in
Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, exiles
alien to the land, the language, and the times; in
St. Domingo, penniless, sick, unwelcome refugees;
and for just one century in Louisiana the jest of the
proud Creole, held down by the triple fetter of illiteracy,
poverty, and the competition of unpaid, half-clad,
swarming slaves. But that now the slave was free,
the school was free, and a new, wide, golden future
waited only on their education in the greatest language
of the world.</p>

<p>All this was pleasant enough to accept even in a
dim way, though too good to be more than remotely
grasped. But just when, as music in a sleeper&rsquo;s ear,
it is taking hold of their impulses somewhat, comes
the word of their hereditary dictator that this man is
among them only for their destruction. What could
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
they reply? They were a people around whom the
entire world&rsquo;s thought had swirled and tumbled for
four hundred years without once touching them. Their
ancestors had left France before Descartes or Newton
had begun to teach the modern world to think. They
knew no method of reasoning save by precedent, and
had never caught the faintest reflection from the mind
of that great, sweet thinker who said, &ldquo;A stubborn
retention of customs is a turbulent thing, no less than
the introduction of new.&rdquo; To such strangers in the
world of to-day now came the contemptuous challenge
of authority, defying them to prove that one who proposed
to launch them forth upon a sea of changes out
of sight of all precedent and tradition was not the
hireling of some enemy&rsquo;s gold secretly paid to sap the
foundations of all their spiritual and temporal interests
and plunge them into chaos.</p>

<p>They blamed Bonaventure; he had got himself hated
and them rebuked; it was enough. They said little
to each other and nothing to him; but they felt the
sleepy sense of injury we all know so well against one
who was disturbing their slumber; and some began to
suspect and distrust him, others to think hard of
him for being suspected and distrusted. Yet all this
reached not his ears, and the first betrayal of it was
from the lips of Chat-ou&eacute;, when, in his cups, he unexpectedly
invited the schoolmaster to leave Grande
Pointe.</p>

<p>After that, even the unconscious schoolmaster could
feel the faint chill of estrangement. But he laid it
not to his work, but to his personal unloveliness, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
said to &rsquo;Mian he did not doubt if he were more engaging
there would not be so many maidens kept at the
wheel and loom in the priceless hours of school, or so
many strapping youths sent, all unlettered, to the
sugar-kettles of the coast plantations what time M&rsquo;sieu&rsquo;
Walleece big-in to gryne.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t dat,&rdquo; said &rsquo;Mian. He had intended to tell
the true reason, but his heart failed him; and when
Bonaventure asked what, then, it was, he replied:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aw, dey don&rsquo;t got no time. Time run so fas&rsquo;,&mdash;run
like a scared dog. I dunno fo&rsquo; w&rsquo;at dey make
dat time run so fas&rsquo; dat way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O my friend,&rdquo; cried the young schoolmaster, leaping
from his chair, &ldquo;say not that! If God did not
make time to p&rsquo;oceed with rapidness, who would ever
do his best?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was such lessons as this that made the children&mdash;Cr&eacute;biche
among them&mdash;still gather round the humble
master and love to grasp his hand.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<h3>LOVE AND DUTY.</h3>


<p>Time ran fast. The seasons were as inexorable at
Grande Pointe as elsewhere. But there was no fierceness
in them. The very frosts were gentle. Slowly
and kindly they stripped the green robes from many
a tree, from many a thicket ejected like defaulting
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
tenants the blue linnet, the orchard oriole, the nonpareil,
took down all its leafy hangings and left it
open to the winds and rain of December. The wet
ponies and kine turned away from the north and
stood in the slanting storm with bowed heads. The
great wall of cypress swamp grew spectral. But its
depths, the marshes far beyond sight behind them,
and the little, hidden, rushy lakes, were alive with
game. No snake crossed the path. Under the roof,
on the gal&eacute;rie, the wheel hummed, the loom pounded;
inside, the logs crackled and blazed on the hearth; on
the board were venison, mallard, teal, rice-birds, <i>sirop
de baterie</i>, and <i>quitte</i>; round the fireside were pipes,
pecans, old stories, and the Saturday-night contra-dance;
and every now and then came sounding on the
outer air the long, hoarse bellow of some Mississippi
steamer, telling of the great world beyond the tree-tops,
a little farther than the clouds and nearer than
the stars.</p>

<p>Christmas passed, and New Year&mdash;time runs so
fast! Presently yonder was &rsquo;Mian himself, spading
a piece of ground to sow his tobacco-seed in; then
Catou and his little boy of twenty-five doing likewise;
and then others all about the scattered village. Then
there was a general spreading of dry brush over the
spaded ground, then the sweet, clean smell of its burning,
and, hanging everywhere throughout the clearing,
its thin blue smoke. The little frogs began to pipe to
each other again in every wet place, the grass began
to freshen, and almost in the calendar&rsquo;s midwinter the
smiles of spring were wreathing everywhere.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
What of the schoolmaster and the children? Much,
much! The good work went on. Intense days for
Bonaventure. The clouds of disfavor darkling in
some places, but brightening in others, and, on the
whole, he hoped and believed, breaking. A few days
of vacation, and then a bright re-union and resumption,
the children all his faithful adherents save one&mdash;Sidonie.
She, a close student, too, but growingly
distant and reticent. The State Superintendent still
believed to be&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Impending, impending, chil&rsquo;run! he is impending!
Any day he may precipitate upon us!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Intense days, too, for Claude. Sidonie openly, and
oh, so sweetly, his friend. Loving him? He could
neither say nor know; enough, for the present, to be
allowed to love her. His love knew no spirit of conquest
yet; it was star-worship; it was angel adoration;
seraphically pure; something so celestially refined that
had it been a tangible object you could have held it
up and seen the stars right through it. The thought
of acquisition would have seemed like coveting the
gold of a temple. And yet already the faintest hint
of loss was intolerable. Oh! this happy, happy school-going,&mdash;this
faring sumptuously on one smile a day!
Ah, if it might but continue! But alas! how Sidonie
was growing! Growing, growing daily! up, up, up!
While he&mdash;there was a tree in the swamp where he
measured his stature every day; but in vain, in vain!
It never budged! And then&mdash;all at once&mdash;like the
rose-vine on her gal&eacute;rie, Sidonie burst into bloom.</p>

<p>Her smiles were kinder and more frequent now than
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
ever before; but the boy&rsquo;s heart was wrung. What
chance now? In four long years to come he would
not yet be quite nineteen, and she was fifteen now.
Four years! He was in no hurry himself&mdash;could
wait forever and be happy every day of it; but she?
Such prize as she, somebody would certainly bear away
before three years could run by, run they ever so fast.</p>

<p>Sitting and pondering one evening in the little bayou
cabin, Claude caught the father&rsquo;s eye upon him, leaned
his forehead upon the parent&rsquo;s knee, and silently wept.
The rough woodman said a kind word, and the boy,
without lifting his burning face, told his love. The
father made no reply for a long time, and then he
said in their quaint old French:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Claude, tell the young schoolmaster. Of all men,
he is the one to help you.&rdquo; And then in English, as
you would quote Latin, &ldquo;Knowledge is power!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next day he missed&mdash;failed miserably&mdash;in
every lesson. At its close he sat at his desk, crushed.
Bonaventure seemed scarce less tempest-tossed than
he; and all about the school the distress spread as
wintry gray overcasts a sky. Only Sidonie moved
calmly her accustomed round, like some fair, silent,
wide-winged bird circling about a wreck.</p>

<p>At length the lad and his teacher were left alone.
Claude sat very still, looking at his toil-worn hands
lying crossed on the desk. Presently there sank an
arm across his shoulders. It was the master&rsquo;s. Drop&mdash;drop&mdash;two
big tears fell upon the rude desk&rsquo;s
sleeve-polished wood. The small, hard, right hand
slowly left its fellow, and rubbed off the wet spots.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
&ldquo;Claude, you have something to disclose me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The drooping head nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And &rsquo;tis not something done wrongly?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lad shook his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, my poor Claude,&rdquo;&mdash;the teacher&rsquo;s own voice
faltered for a moment,&mdash;&ldquo;then&mdash;&rsquo;tis&mdash;&rsquo;tis she!&rdquo;
He stroked the weeping head that sank into its hands.
&ldquo;Ah! yes, Claude, yes; &rsquo;tis she; &rsquo;tis she! And you
want me to help you. Alas! in vain you want me!
I cannot even try-y-y to help you; you have mentioned
it too lately! &rsquo;Tis right you come to me,
despiting discrepancy of years; but alas! the dif<em>fic</em>ulty
lies in the con<em>tra</em>ry; for alas! Claude, our two heart&rsquo;
are of the one, same age!&rdquo;</p>

<p>They went out; and walking side by side toward the
failing sun, with the humble flowers of the field and
path newly opened and craving leave to live about their
feet and knees, Bonaventure Deschamps revealed his
own childlike heart to the simple boy whose hand
clasped his.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes; I conceal not from you, Claude, that
&rsquo;tis not alone &lsquo;thou lovest,&rsquo; but &lsquo;I love&rsquo;! If with
cause to hope, Claude, I know not. And I must not
search to know whilst yet the schoolmaster. And the
same to you, Claude, whilst yet a scholah. We mus&rsquo;
let the dissimulation like a worm in the bud to h-eat
our cheek. &rsquo;Tis the voice of honor cry&mdash;&lsquo;Silence.&rsquo;
And during the meanwhilst, you? Perchance at the
last, the years passing and you enlarging in size daily
and arriving to budding manhood, may be the successful;
for suspect not I consider lightly the youngness
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
of yo&rsquo; passion. Attend what I shall reveal you.
Claude, there once was a boy, yo&rsquo; size, yo&rsquo; age, but
fierce, selfish, distemperate; still more selfish than yo&rsquo;
schoolmaster of to-day.&rdquo; And there that master went
on to tell of an early&mdash;like Claude&rsquo;s, an all too early&mdash;rash,
and boyish passion, whose ragged wound,
that he had thought never could heal, was now only a
tender scar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you, too, Claude, though now it seem not
possible&mdash;you shall recuperate from this. But why
say I thus? Think you I would inoculate the idea
that you must despair? Nay, perchance you shall
achieve her.&rdquo; They stood near the lad&rsquo;s pirogue
about to say adieu; the schoolmaster waved his hand
backward toward the farther end of the village. &ldquo;She
is there; in a short time she will cease to continue
scholah; then&mdash;try.&rdquo; And again, with still more
courageous kindness, he repeated, &ldquo;Try! &rsquo;Tis a
lesson that thou shouldest heed&mdash;try, try again. If
<em>at</em> the first thou doest <em>not</em> succeed, try, try again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Claude gazed gratefully into the master&rsquo;s face. Boy
that he was, he did not read aright the anguish gathering
there. From his own face the clouds melted into
a glad sunshine of courage, resolve, and anticipation.
Bonaventure saw the spark of hope that he had dropped
into the boy&rsquo;s heart blaze up into his face. And what
did Claude see? The hot blood mounting to the master&rsquo;s
brow an instant ere he wheeled and hurried away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Sieur Bonaventure!&rdquo; exclaimed Claude; &ldquo;&rsquo;Sieur
Bonaventure!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But deaf to all tones alike, Bonaventure moved
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
straight away along the bushy path, and was
presently gone from sight. There is a repentance of
good deeds. Bonaventure Deschamps felt it gnawing
and tearing hard and harder within his bosom as he
strode on through the wild vernal growth that closed
in the view on every side. Soon he halted; then
turned, and began to retrace his steps.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Claude!&rdquo; The tone was angry and imperative.
No answer came. He quickened his gait. &ldquo;Claude!&rdquo;
The voice was petulant and imperious. A turn of the
path brought again to view the spot where the two had
so lately parted. No one was there. He moaned and
then cried aloud, &ldquo;O thou fool, fool, fool!&mdash;Claude!&rdquo;
He ran; faster&mdash;faster&mdash;down the path, away from
all paths, down the little bayou&rsquo;s margin, into the
bushes, into the mud and water. &ldquo;Claude! Claude!
I told you wrongly! Stop! <i>Arretez-la!</i> I must add
somewhat!&mdash;Claude!&rdquo; The bushes snatched away
his hat; tore his garments; bled him in hands and
face; yet on he went into the edge of the forest.
&ldquo;Claude! Ah! Claude, thou hast ruin&rsquo; me! Stop,
you young rascal!&mdash;thief!&mdash;robber!&mdash;brigand!&rdquo; A
vine caught and held him fast. &ldquo;Claude! Claude!&rdquo;&mdash;The
echoes multiplied the sound, and scared from
their dead-tree roost a flock of vultures. The dense
wood was wrapping the little bayou in its premature
twilight. The retreating sun, that for a while had shot
its flaming arrows through the black boles and branches,
had sunk now and was gone. Only a parting ruby
glow shone through the tangle where far and wide the
echoes were calling for Claude.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
&ldquo;Claude! I mistook the facts in the case. There
is no hope for you! &rsquo;Tis futile you try&mdash;the poem is
not for you! I take every thing back!&mdash;all back!
You shall not once try! You have grasp&rsquo; the advantage!
You got no business, you little rascal! <em>You</em>
dare venture to attempt making love in my school!
Claude St. Pierre, you are dismiss&rsquo; the school! Mutiny!
mutiny! Claude St. Pierre, for mutinizing, excluded
the Gran&rsquo; Point&rsquo; school.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He tore himself from his fastenings and hastened
back toward the village. The tempest within him was
as fierce as ever; but already it, too, had turned and
was coming out of the opposite quarter. The better
Bonaventure&mdash;the Bonaventure purified by fires that
Grande Pointe had no knowledge of&mdash;was coming
back into his gentle self-mastery. And because that
other, that old-time Bonaventure, bound in chains
deep down within, felt already the triumph of a
moment slipping from his grasp, he silently now to
the outer air, but loudly within, railed and gnashed
and tore himself the more.</p>

<p>He regained the path and hurried along it, hatless,
dishevelled, bespattered, and oblivious to every thing
save the war within. Presently there came upon him
the knowledge, the certain knowledge, that Claude
would come the next morning and ring the chapel bell,
take his seat in school, stand in all his classes, know
every lesson, and go home in the evening happy and
all unchallenged of him. He groaned aloud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! Claude! To dismiss or not to dismiss, it
shall not be mine! But it shall be thine, Sidonie! And
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
whether she is for thee, Claude&mdash;so juvenile!&mdash;or for
me, so unfit, unfit, unfit!&mdash;Ah! Sidonie, choose not
yet!&rdquo;&mdash;He stood rooted to the spot; while within
easy earshot of his lightest word tripped brightly and
swiftly across the path from the direction of the chapel
a fawn, Claude&rsquo;s gift, and its mistress, Sidonie&mdash;as
though she neither saw nor heard.</p>

<h3><a name="PART_II_CHAP_VIII" id="PART_II_CHAP_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>

<h3>AT CLAUDE&rsquo;S MERCY.</h3>


<p>Time flagged not. The school shone on, within its
walls making glad the teacher and the pupils with ever
new achievements in knowledge and excellence. Some
of the vanguard&mdash;Claude, Sidonie, &Eacute;tienne, Madelaine,
Henri, Marcelline&mdash;actually going into the
Third Reader. Such perfection in lessons as they told
about at home&mdash;such mastery of English, such satisfactory
results in pronunciation and emphasis! Reading
just as they talked? Oh, no, a thousand times no!
The school&rsquo;s remoter light, its secondary influences,
slowly spreading, but so slowly that only the eyes of
enmity could see its increase. There were murmurs
and head-shakings; but the thirteenth Sunday of the
year&rsquo;s first quarter came, and the sermon whose withholding
had been threatened was preached. And on
the thirteenth Monday there was Bonaventure, still
moving quietly across the green toward the schoolhouse
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
with the children all about him. But a few
days later the unexpected happened.</p>

<p>By this time Claude&rsquo;s father, whose teacher, you
remember, was Claude, had learned to read. One day
a surveyor, who had employed him as a guide, seeing
the Acadian laboring over a fragment of rural newspaper,
fell into conversation with him as they sat
smoking by their camp-fire, and presently caught some
hint of St. Pierre&rsquo;s aspirations for himself and his son.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So there&rsquo;s a public school at Grande Pointe, is
there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yass; fine school; hondred feet long! and
fine titcher; splendid titcher; titch English.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well!&rdquo; laughed the surveyor. &ldquo;Well, the
next thing will be a railroad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>St. Pierre&rsquo;s eyes lighted up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You t&rsquo;ink!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, yes; you can&rsquo;t keep railroads away from a
place long, once you let in the public school and teach
English.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You t&rsquo;ink dass good?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, a railroad? Most certainly. It brings
immigration.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whass dat&mdash;&rsquo;migrash&rsquo;n?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The surveyor explained.</p>

<p>The next time St. Pierre came to Grande Pointe&mdash;to
sell some fish&mdash;he came armed with two great
words for the final overthrow of all opponents of
enlightenment: &ldquo;Rellroad!&mdash;&rsquo;Migrash&rsquo;n!&rdquo;</p>

<p>They had a profound and immediate effect&mdash;exactly
the opposite of what he had expected.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
The school had just been dismissed; the children
were still in sight, dispersing this way and that.
Sidonie lingered a moment at her desk, putting it in
order; Claude, taking all the time he could, was getting
his canoe-paddle from a corner; Cr&eacute;biche was waiting,
by the master&rsquo;s command, to repair some default of
the day; and Toutou, outside on his knees in the grass
catching grasshoppers, was tarrying for his sister;
when four or five of the village&rsquo;s best men came slowly
and hesitatingly in. It required no power of divination
for even the pre-occupied schoolmaster to guess
the nature of their errand. &rsquo;Mian was not among
them. Catou was at their head. They silently bowed.
The schoolmaster as silently responded. The visitors
huddled together. They came a step nearer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Catou, &ldquo;we come to see you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sirs, welcome to Gran&rsquo; Point&rsquo; school.&mdash;Sidonie,
Cr&eacute;biche, Claude, rest in yo&rsquo; seats.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mo&rsquo; betteh you tu&rsquo;n &rsquo;em loose, I t&rsquo;ink,&rdquo; said
Catou amiably; &ldquo;ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I rather they stay,&rdquo; replied Bonaventure. All
sat down. There was a sustained silence, and then
Catou said with quiet abruptness:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We dawn&rsquo;t want no mo&rsquo; school!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;From what cause?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t no use.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir&mdash;sirs, no use? &rsquo;Tis every use! The schoolhouse?
&rsquo;tis mo&rsquo; worth than the gole mine. Ah! sirs,
tell me: what is gole without education?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They confronted the riddle for a moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ed&rsquo;cation want to change every thin&rsquo;&mdash;rellroad&mdash;&rsquo;migrash&rsquo;n.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
&ldquo;Change every thing? Yes!&mdash;making every thing
better! Sirs, where is that country that the people
are sorry that the railroad and the schoolhouse have
come?&rdquo; Again the riddle went unanswered; but
Catou sat as if in meditation, looking to one side, and
presently said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I t&rsquo;ink dass all humbug, dat titchin&rsquo; English.
What want titch English faw?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; cried Bonaventure, &ldquo;in America you mus&rsquo;
be American! Three Acadians have been governor
of Louisiana! What made them thus to become?&rdquo;
He leaned forward and smote his hands together.
&ldquo;What was it? &rsquo;Twas English education!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The men were silent again. Catou pushed his feet
out, and looked at his shoes, put on for the occasion.
Presently&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yass,&rdquo; he said, in an unconvinced tone; &ldquo;yass,
dass all right: but how we know you titch English?
Nobody can&rsquo;t tell you titchin&rsquo; him right or no.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And yet&mdash;I do! And the time approach when
you shall know! Sirs, I make to you a p&rsquo;oposition.
Time is passing. It must be soon the State Sup&rsquo;inten&rsquo;ent
Public Education visit this school. The school
is any time ready. Since long time are we waiting.
He shall come&mdash;he shall examine! The chil&rsquo;run shall
be ignorant this arrangement! Only these shall know&mdash;Claude,
Sidonie, Cr&eacute;biche; they will not disclose!
And the total chil&rsquo;run shall exhibit all their previous
learning! And welcome the day, when the ad<em>ver</em>saries
of education shall see those dear chil&rsquo;run stan&rsquo;
up befo&rsquo; the assem&rsquo;led Gran&rsquo; Point&rsquo; spelling co&rsquo;ectly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
words of one to eight syllable&rsquo; and <em>reading from their
readers</em>! And if one miss&mdash;if <em>one</em>&mdash;<em>one!</em> miss, then
let the school be shut and the schoolmaster banish-ed!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was so agreed. The debate did not cease at once,
but it languished. Catou thought he had made one
strong point when he objected to education as conducive
to idle habits; but when the schoolmaster hurled
back the fact that communities the world over are industrious
just in proportion as they are educated, he
was done. He did not know, but when he confronted
the assertion it looked so true that he could not doubt
it. He only said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, anyhow, I t&rsquo;ink &rsquo;tain&rsquo;t no use Cr&eacute;biche go
school no mo&rsquo;.&rdquo; But when Bonaventure pleaded for
the lad&rsquo;s continuance, that too was agreed upon. The
men departed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cr&eacute;biche,&rdquo; said the master, holding the boy&rsquo;s
hand at parting, &ldquo;ah! Cr&eacute;biche, if thou become not a
good scholar&rdquo;&mdash;and read a promise in the boy&rsquo;s
swimming eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Claude, Claude, I am at yo&rsquo; mercy now.&rdquo; But
the honest gaze of Claude and the pressure of his small
strong hand were a pledge. The grateful master turned
to Sidonie, and again, as of old, no Sidonie was there.</p>

<h3><a name="PART_II_CHAP_IX" id="PART_II_CHAP_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX.</h3>

<h3>READY.</h3>


<p>Summer came. The song-birds were all back again,
waking at dawn, and making the hoary cypress wood
merry with their carollings to the wives and younglings
in the nests. Busy times. Foraging on the helpless
enemy&mdash;earth-worm, gnat, grub, grasshopper, weevil,
sawyer, dragon-fly&mdash;from morning till night: watching
for him; scratching for him; picking, pecking, boring
for him; poising, swooping, darting for him; standing
upside down and peering into chinks for him; and all
for the luxury&mdash;not of knowledge, but of love and
marriage. The mocking-bird had no rest whatever.
Back and forth from dawn to dark, back and forth
across and across Grande Pointe clearing, always one
way empty and the other way with his beak full of
marketing; and then sitting up on an average half the
night&mdash;sometimes the whole of it&mdash;at his own concert.
And with military duties too; patrolling the
earth below, a large part of it, and all the upper air;
driving off the weasel, the black snake, the hawk, the
jay, the buzzard, the crow, and all that brigand crew&mdash;busy
times! All nature in glad, gay earnest.
Corn in blossom and rustling in the warm breeze;
blackberries ripe; morning-glories under foot; the
trumpet-flower flaring from its dense green vine high
above on the naked, girdled tree; the cotton-plant
blooming white, yellow, and red in the field beneath;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
honey a-making in the hives and hollow trees; butterflies
and bees lingering in the fields at sunset; the
moth venturing forth at the first sign of dew; and
Sidonie&mdash;a wild-rose tree.</p>

<p>Mark you, this was in Grande Pointe. I have seen
the wild flower taken from its cool haunt in the forest,
and planted in the glare of a city garden. Alas! the
plight of it, poor outshone, wilting, odorless thing!
And then I have seen it again in the forest; and pleasanter
than to fill the lap with roses and tulips of the
conservatory&rsquo;s blood-royal it was to find it there, once
more the simple queen of that green solitude.</p>

<p>So Sidonie. Acadian maidens are shy as herons.
They always see you first. They see you first, silently
rise, and are gone&mdash;from the gal&eacute;rie. They are more
shy than violets. You would think they lived whole
days with those dark, black-fringed eyes cast down;
but&mdash;they see you first. The work about the house is
well done where they are; there are apt to be flowers
outside round about; while they themselves are as Paul
desired to see the women in bishop Timothy&rsquo;s church,
&ldquo;adorned in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and
sobriety.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Flowers sprang plentifully where Sidonie dwelt.
Her best homespun gown was her own weaving; the
old dog lying on the gal&eacute;rie always thumped the floor
with his tail and sank his obsequious head as that robe
passed; the fawn&mdash;that Claude had brought&mdash;would
come trotting and press its head against it; all the
small living things of the dooryard would follow it
about; and if she stood by the calf-pen the calves
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
would push each other for the nearest place, lay their
cheeks upon the fence&rsquo;s top, and roll their eyes&mdash;as
many a youth of Grande Pointe would have done if he
might. Chat-ou&eacute;,&mdash;I fear I have omitted to mention
that the father of Cr&eacute;biche, like the father of Claude,
had lost his wife before he was of age,&mdash;Chat-ou&eacute;
looked often over that fence.</p>

<p>When matters take that shape a girl <em>must</em> quit school.
And yet Sidonie, when after a short vacation the
school resumed its sessions, resumed with it. Toutou,
who had to admit now that his sister was even more
grand for her age than he, was always available for
protection. There was no wonder that Sidonie wished
to continue; Bonaventure explained why:</p>

<p>&ldquo;So in<em>ter</em>esting is that McGuffey&rsquo;s Third Reader!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Those at home hesitated, and presently it was the
first of October. Now it was too late to withdraw;
the examination was to take place. The school&rsquo;s opponents
had expressed little impatience at the State
Superintendent&rsquo;s weary delay, but at length Catou
asked, &ldquo;Why dat man don&rsquo;t nevva come!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The wherefore of his non-coming I ignore,&rdquo; said
Bonaventure, with a look of old pain in his young
face; &ldquo;but I am ready, let him come or let him come
not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t no use wait no longer,&rdquo; said Catou; &ldquo;jis
well have yo&rsquo; lil show widout him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir, it shall be had! Revolution never go backwood!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Much was the toil, many the anxieties, of the preparation.
For Bonaventure at once determined to make
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
the affair more than an examination. He set its date
on the anniversary of the day when he had come to
Grande Pointe. From such a day Sidonie could not
be spared. She was to say a piece, a poem, an apostrophe
to a star. A child, beholding the little star in
the heavens, and wondering what it can be, sparkling
diamond-like so high up above the world, exhorts it
not to stop twinkling on his account. But to its tender
regret the school knew that no more thereafter was
Sidonie to twinkle in its firmament.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Learn yo&rsquo; lessons hard, chil&rsquo;run; if the State
Sup&rsquo;inten&rsquo;ent, even at the last, you know&rdquo;&mdash;Bonaventure
could not believe that this important outpost
had been forgotten.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<h3><a name="PART_II_CHAP_X" id="PART_II_CHAP_X"></a>CHAPTER X.</h3>

<h3>CONSPIRACY.</h3>


<p>About this time a certain Mr. Tarbox&mdash;G. W.
Tarbox&mdash;was travelling on horseback and touching
from house to house of the great sugar-estates of the
river &ldquo;coast,&rdquo; seeing the country and people, and
allowing the <i>&eacute;lite</i> to subscribe to the &ldquo;Album of Universal
Information.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One Sunday, resting at College Point, he was led by
curiosity to cultivate the acquaintance of three men
who had come in from Grande Pointe. One of them
was Chat-ou&eacute;. He could understand them, and make
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
them understand him, well enough to play <i>vingt et un</i>
with them the whole forenoon. He won all their
money, drank with them, and took their five subscriptions,
Chat-ou&eacute; taking three&mdash;one for himself, one for
Catou, and one for Cr&eacute;biche. There was no delivery
of goods there and then; they could not write; but
they made their marks, and it was agreed that when
Mr. Tarbox should come along a few days later to deliver
the volumes, they were not to be received or paid
for until with his scholarly aid the impostor who pretended
to teach English education at Grande Pointe
had been put to confusion and to flight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Tarbox; &ldquo;all <em>right</em>. I&rsquo;m the
kind of State Superintendent you want. I like an
adventure; and if there&rsquo;s any thing I just love, it&rsquo;s
exposing a fraud! What day shall I come? Yes, I
understand&mdash;middle of the day. I&rsquo;ll be on hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fateful day came. In every house and on every
gal&eacute;rie the morning tasks were early done. Then the
best of every wardrobe was put on, the sun soared
high, and by noon every chair in Grande Pointe was
in the tobacco-shed where knowledge poured forth her
beams, and was occupied by one or two persons. And
then, at last, the chapel bell above Claude&rsquo;s head
pealed out the final signal, and the schoolmaster moved
across the green. Bonaventure Deschamps was weary.
Had aught gone wrong? Far from it. But the work
had been great, and it was now done. Every thing was
at stake: the cause of enlightenment and the fortunes
of his heart hung on the issue of the next few hours.
Three pupils, one the oftenest rebuked of all the school,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
one his rival in love, one the queen of his heart, held
his fate in their hands and knew it. With these
thoughts mingled the pangs of an unconfessed passion
and the loneliness of a benevolent nature famishing for
a word of thanks. Yea, and to-day he must be his own
judge.</p>

<p>His coat was on his arm, and the children round
about him in their usual way as they came across the
common; but his words, always so kind, were, on this
day of all days, so dejected and so few that the little
ones stole glances into his face and grew silent. Then,
all at once, he saw,&mdash;yea, verily, he <em>saw</em>,&mdash;standing
near the school entrance, a man from the great outer
world!</p>

<p>He knew it by a hundred signs&mdash;the free attitude,
the brilliant silk hat, the shaven face, and every inch of
the attire. As plainly as one knows a green tree from
a dead one, the Crusoe of Grande Pointe recognized one
who came from the haunts of men; from some great
nerve-centre of human knowledge and power where the
human mind, trained and equipped, had piled up the
spoils of its innumerable conquests. His whole form
lighted up with a new life. His voice trembled with
pent feeling as he said in deep undertone:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be callm, chil&rsquo;run; be callm. Refrain excitement.
Who you behole befo&rsquo; you, yondeh, I ignore. But
who shall we expect to see if not the State Sup&rsquo;inten&rsquo;ent
Public Education? And if yea, then welcome,
thrice welcome, the surprise! We shall not inquire
him; but as a stranger we shall show him with how
small reso&rsquo;ce how large result.&rdquo; He put on his coat.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
Mr. Tarbox had just reached the school-ground.
His horse was fastened by the bridle to a picket in a
fence behind him. A few boys had been out before
the schoolhouse, and it was the sudden cessation of
their clamor that had drawn Bonaventure&rsquo;s attention.
Some of them were still visible, silently slipping
through the gaps in the <i>pieux</i> and disappearing within.
Bonaventure across the distance marked him beckon
persuasively to one of them. The lad stopped, came
forward, and gave his hand; and thereupon a second,
a third, fourth, fifth, tenth, without waiting for invitation,
emerged again and advanced to the same grave
and silent ceremony. Two or three men who stood
near did the same. The handshaking was just ending
when Bonaventure and the stranger raised their hats
to each other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Trust I don&rsquo;t intrude?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir, we are honored, not intruded, as you shall
witness. Will you give yourself the pain to enter the
school-place? I say not schoolhouse; &rsquo;tis, as its humble
teacher, not fitly so nominated. But you shall
therein find a school which, the more taken by surprise,
not the less prepared.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The State ought to build you a good schoolhouse,&rdquo;
said the stranger, with a slight frown that seemed
official.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! sir,&rdquo; cried the young schoolmaster, beaming
gratitude from his whole surface, &ldquo;I&mdash;I&rdquo;&mdash;he smote
his breast,&mdash;&ldquo;I would reimburst her in good citizen&rsquo;
and mother&rsquo; of good citizen&rsquo;! And both reading,
writing, and also ciphering,&mdash;arithmeticulating, in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
English tongue, and grammatically! But enter and
investigate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A hush fell upon the school and the audience beyond
it as the two men came in. Every scholar was in place&mdash;the
little ones with bare, dangling feet, their shapely
sun-tanned ankles just peeping from pantaloons and
pantalettes of equal length; the older lads beyond
them; and off at the left the larger girls, and Sidonie.
The visitor, as his eye fell last upon her, silently and
all to himself drew a long whistle of admiration. The
master stood and eyed him with unspoken but confessed
pride. A little maiden of six slipped from the bench
to the earth floor, came forward, gave her hand, and
noiselessly returned. One by one, with eyes dropped,
the remaining sixteen girls followed. It seemed for a
moment as if the contagion might break out in the
audience, but the symptom passed.</p>

<p>There was just room on the teacher&rsquo;s little platform
for Bonaventure to seat his visitor a little at one side
and stand behind his desk. The fateful moment had
come. The master stood nervously drawn up, bell in
hand. With a quick, short motion he gave it one tap,
and set it down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That, sir, is to designate attention!&rdquo; He waved
a triumphant hand toward the spectacle before them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perfect!&rdquo; murmured the stranger. A look of
earnest ecstasy broke out upon the master&rsquo;s face. He
turned at first upon the audience and then upon the
school.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Chil&rsquo;run, <em>chil&rsquo;run</em>, he p&rsquo;onounce you perfect!&rdquo;
He turned again upon the visitor, threw high his right
hand, flirted it violently, and cried:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
&ldquo;At random! exclusively at random; state what
class! at random!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I doubt if I under&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Name any class, exclusively at random, and you
shall see with what promptness and quietude the chil&rsquo;run
shall take each one their exactly co&rsquo;ect places.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I understand. You want me to designate&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Any class! at yo&rsquo; caprice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if you have&mdash;third class in geography.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or spelling?&rdquo; cried Bonaventure, a momentary
look of dismay giving place to fresh enthusiasm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;spell&mdash;I meant spelling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Third spelling!&rdquo; The tongue of the bell fell with
the emphasis, and as silently as sleep the tiniest seven
in the school, four pairs of pantaloons, three of pantalettes,
with seven of little bare feet at their borders
and seven of hands pointed down stiffly at their sides,
came out and stood a-row. The master turned to the
visitor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, commencing wherever, even at the foot if
desired! ask, sir, if you please, any English word of
one syllable, of however difficult!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No matter how difficult?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, they are timid, as you see; advance by
degrees.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, then,&rdquo; said the visitor with much kindness
of tone; &ldquo;I will ask the little boy at this end&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At the foot&mdash;but&mdash;still, &rsquo;tis well. Only&mdash;ah,
Cr&eacute;biche! every thing depend! Be prepared, Cr&eacute;biche!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the stranger; &ldquo;I will ask him to spell
hoss.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
The child drew himself up rigidly, pointed his stiffened
fingers down his thighs, rounded his pretty red
mouth, and said slowly, in a low, melodious, distinct
voice:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;O-double eth, awth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bonaventure leapt from the platform and ran to the
child.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Ah! mon p&rsquo;tit gar&ccedil;on</i>&mdash;ah! my lil boy! &rsquo;O-double
eth, listten, my chile. O, sir, he did not hear
the word precisely. Listten, my chile, to yo&rsquo; teacher!
remember that his honor and the school&rsquo;s honor is in
yo&rsquo; spelling!&rdquo; He drew back a step, poised himself,
and gave the word. It came like an anchor-chain
crashing through a hawse-hole.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or-r-r-r-rus-seh!&rdquo; And the child, winking at
vacancy in the intensity of his attention, spelled:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Haich-o-r-eth-e, &rsquo;Orthe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The breathless audience, leaning forward, read the
visitor&rsquo;s commendation in his face. Bonaventure,
beaming upon him, extended one arm, the other turned
toward the child, and cried, shaking both hands tremulously:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Another! another word! another to the same!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mouse,&rdquo; said the stranger, and Bonaventure
turned and cried:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mah-ooseh! my nob&rsquo;e lil boy! Mah-ooseh!&rdquo; and
Cr&eacute;biche, a speaking statue, spelled:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;M-o-u-eth-e, mouthe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Co&rsquo;ect, my chile! And yet, sir, and yet, &rsquo;tis he
that they call Cr&eacute;biche, because like the crawfish advancing
backwardly. But to the next! another word!
another word!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
The spelling, its excitements, its moments of agonizing
suspense, and its triumphs, went on. The
second class is up. It spells in two, even in three,
syllables. Toutou is in it. He gets tremendously
wrought up; cannot keep two feet on the ground at
once; spells fast when the word is his; smiles in
response to the visitor&rsquo;s smile, the only one who dares;
leans out and looks down the line with a knuckle in his
mouth as the spelling passes down; wrings one hand
as his turn approaches again; catches his word in
mid-air and tosses it off, and marks with ecstasy the
triumph and pride written on the face of his master.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, sir,&rdquo; cries Bonaventure, &ldquo;why consume the
spelling-book? Give, yourself, if you please, to
Toutou, a word not therein comprise&rsquo;.&rdquo; He glanced
around condescendingly upon the people of Grande
Pointe. Chat-ou&eacute; is in a front seat. Toutou gathers
himself for the spring, and the stranger ponders a
moment and then gives&mdash;&ldquo;Florida!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;F-l-o, flo, warr-de-warr-da,&mdash;Florida!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A smile broke from the visitor&rsquo;s face unbidden,
but&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right! my chile! co&rsquo;ect, Toutou!&rdquo; cried Bonaventure,
running and patting the little hero on the back
and head by turns. &ldquo;Sir, let us&rdquo;&mdash;He stopped
short. The eyes of the house were on Chat-ou&eacute;. He
had risen to his feet and made a gesture for the visitor&rsquo;s
attention. As the stranger looked at him he
asked:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He spell dat las word r-i-i-ight?&rdquo; But the visitor
with quiet gravity said, &ldquo;Yes, that was all right;&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
and a companion pulled the Raccoon down into his
seat again. Bonaventure resumed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir, let us not exhoss the time with spelling! You
shall now hear them read.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The bell taps, the class retires; again, and the
reading class is up. They are the larger girls and
boys. But before they begin the master has a word
for their fathers and mothers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Friends and fellow-citizens of Gran&rsquo; Point&rsquo;, think
not at the suppi-zing goodness of yo&rsquo; chil&rsquo;run&rsquo; reading.
&rsquo;Tis to this branch has been given the largest attention
and most as<em>sid</em>u&rsquo;ty, so thus to comprise puffection in
the English tongue, whether speaking aw otherwise.&rdquo;
He turned to the stranger beside him. &ldquo;I am not satisfied
whilst the slightest accent of French is remaining.
But you shall judge if they read not as if in their own
vernaculary. And you shall choose the piece!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The visitor waived the privilege, but Bonaventure
gently insisted, and he selected Jane Taylor&rsquo;s little
poem, &ldquo;The Violet,&rdquo; glancing across at Sidonie as he
himself read out the first two lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Down in a green and shady bed<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A modest violet grew.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Bonaventure proclaimed the title and page and
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Claude, p&rsquo;oceed!&rdquo; And Claude read:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Dthee vy&mdash;ee-lit. Dah-oon-a hin hay grin and-a
shad-y bade&mdash;A mo-dest-a vy-ee-lit gr&#335;o&mdash;Hits-a

maheet-a h&#257;ve grass-ed a rozzy bow&rsquo;r&mdash;Heenstade-a

<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; cried Bonaventure; &ldquo;stop! You pronounciate&rsquo;
a word faultily!&rdquo; He turned to the visitor.
&ldquo;I call not that a miss; but we must inoculate the
idea of puffection. So soon the sly-y-test misp&rsquo;onounciating
I pass to the next.&rdquo; He turned again:
&ldquo;Next!&rdquo; And a black-haired girl began in a higher
key, and very slowly:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yate there eet whoz cawntaint-a too bulloom&mdash;Heen
mo-dest-a teent z-arrayed&mdash;And there-a heet

<p>&ldquo;Stop! Not that you mistook, but&mdash;&rsquo;tis enough.
Sir, will you give yourself the pain to tell&mdash;not for
my sake or reputation, but to the encouragement of
the chil&rsquo;run, and devoid flattery&mdash;what is yo&rsquo; opinion
of that specimen of reading? Not t&rsquo;oubling you, but,
in two or three word&rsquo; only&mdash;if you will give yo&rsquo;self
the pain&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, certainly; I think it is&mdash;I can hardly find
words&mdash;it&rsquo;s remarkable.&rdquo; Bonaventure started with
joy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Chil&rsquo;run, do you hear? Remawkable! But do
you not detect no slight&mdash;no small faultiness of
p&rsquo;onounciating?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, not the slightest; I smile, but I was thinking
of something else.&rdquo; The visitor&rsquo;s eye, wandering a
trifle, caught Chat-ou&eacute; giving him one black look that
removed his disposition to smile, yet he insisted, &ldquo;No,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
sir; I can truthfully say I never heard such a pronunciation.&rdquo;
The audience drank his words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; cried the glad preceptor, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis toil have
p&rsquo;oduce it! Toil of the teacher, in<em>dust</em>ry of the chil&rsquo;run!
But it has p&rsquo;oduce&rsquo; <em>beside</em>! Sir, look&mdash;that
school! Since one year commencing the A B C&mdash;and
now spelling word&rsquo; of eight syllabl&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not <em>this</em> school?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir, you shall see&mdash;or, more p&rsquo;operly, hear.
First spelling!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the stranger, seeing Sidonie rise, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
like to hear that class;&rdquo; and felt Chat-ou&eacute; looking at
him again.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<h3><a name="PART_II_CHAP_XI" id="PART_II_CHAP_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI.</h3>

<h3>LIGHT, LOVE, AND VICTORY.</h3>


<p>The bell tapped, and they came forth to battle.
There was the line, there was the leader. The great
juncture of the day was on him. Was not here the
State&rsquo;s official eye? Did not victory hover overhead?
His reserve, the darling regiment, the flower of his
army, was dressing for the final charge. There was
Claude. Next him, Sidonie!&mdash;and &Eacute;tienne, and
Madelaine, Henri and Marcelline,&mdash;all waiting for
the word&mdash;the words&mdash;of eight syllables! Supreme
moment! Would any betray? Banish the thought!
Would any fail?</p>

<p>He waited an instant while two or three mothers
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
bore out great armfuls of slumbering or fretting infancy
and a number of young men sank down into the
vacated chairs. Then he stepped down from the platform,
drew back four or five yards from the class,
opened the spelling-book, scanned the first word,
closed the book with his finger at the place, lifted it
high above his head, and cried:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Claude! Claude, my brave scholar, always perfect,
ah you ready?&rdquo; He gave the little book a half
whirl round, and dashed forward toward the chosen
scholar, crying as he came:</p>

<p>&ldquo;In-e-rad-i-ca-bility!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Claude&rsquo;s face suddenly set in a stony vacancy,
and with his eyes staring straight before him he
responded:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I-n, in-, e, inerad-, r-a-d, rad-, inerad-, ineraddy-,
ineradica-, c-a, ca, ineradica-, ineradicabili-, b-i-elly-billy,
ineradicabili-, ineradicabili-, t-y, ty, ineradicability.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right! Claude, my boy! my always good scholar,
right!&rdquo; The master drew back to his starting-place
as he spoke, re-opened the book, shut it again, lifted
it high in air, cried, &ldquo;Madelaine, my dear chile,
prepare!&rdquo; whirled the book and rushed upon her
with&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In-de-fat-i-ga-bil-ly-ty!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Madelaine turned to stone and began:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I-n, een, d-e, de-, inde-, indefat-, indefat&mdash;fat&mdash;f-a-t,
fat, indefat, indefatty, i, ty, indefati-, indefatiga-,
g-a, ga, indefatiga-, indefatigabilly, b-i-elly, billy, indefatigabili-,
t-y, ty, indefatigability.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
&ldquo;O, Madelaine, my chile, you make yo&rsquo; teacher
proud! prah-ood, my chile!&rdquo; Bonaventure&rsquo;s hand
rested a moment tenderly on her head as he looked
first toward the audience and then toward the stranger.
Then he drew off for the third word. He looked at it
twice before he called it. Then&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sidonie! ah! Sidonie, be ready! be prepared!
fail not yo&rsquo; humble school-teacher! In-com&rdquo;&mdash;He
looked at the word a third time, and then swept down
upon her:</p>

<p>&ldquo;In-com-pre-hen-si-ca-<em>bility</em>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sidonie flinched not nor looked upon him, as he
hung over her with the spelling-book at arm&rsquo;s-reach
above them; yet the pause that followed seemed to
speak dismay, and throughout the class there was a
silent recoil from something undiscovered by the master.
But an instant later Sidonie had chosen between
the two horns of her agonizing dilemma, and began:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I-n, een, c-o-m, cawm, eencawm, eencawmpre,
p-r-e, pre, eencawmpre, eencawmprehen, prehen, haich-e-n,
hen, hen, eencawmprehensi, s-i, si, eencawmprehensi-,
b-i-l&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! Sidonie! Stop! <i>Arretez!</i> Si-do-nie-e-e-e!
Oh! listen&mdash;<i>&eacute;coutez</i>&mdash;Sidonie, my dear!&rdquo; The master
threw his arms up and down in distraction, then
suddenly faced his visitor, &ldquo;Sir, it was my blame!
I spoke the word without adequate distinction! Sidonie&mdash;<i>maintenant</i>&mdash;now!&rdquo;
But a voice in the audience
interrupted with&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Assoiez-vous la</i>, Chat-ou&eacute;! Seet down yondeh!&rdquo;
And at the potent voice of Maximian Roussel the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
offender was pushed silently into the seat he had risen
from, and Bonaventure gave the word again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In-com-pre-hen-si-ca-bil-i-ty!&rdquo; And Sidonie,
blushing like fire, returned to the task:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I-n, een&rdquo;&mdash;She bit her lip and trembled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right! <em>Right!</em> Tremble not, my Sidonie! fear
naught! yo&rsquo; loving school-teacher is at thy side!&rdquo;
But she trembled like a red leaf as she spelled on&mdash;&ldquo;Haich-e-n,
hen, eencawmprehen, eencawmprehensi,
s-i, si, eencawmprehensi-, eencawmprehensi-billy-t-y,
ty, incomprehensibility!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The master dropped his hands and lifted his eyes in
speechless despair. As they fell again upon Sidonie,
her own met them. She moaned, covered her face
in her hands, burst into tears, ran to her desk and
threw her hands and face upon it, shaking with noiseless
sobs and burning red to the nape of her perfect
neck. All Grande Pointe rose to its feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lost!&rdquo; cried Bonaventure in a heart-broken voice.
&ldquo;Every thing lost! Farewell, chil&rsquo;run!&rdquo; He opened
his arms toward them and with one dash all the lesser
ones filled them. They wept. Tears welled from
Bonaventure&rsquo;s eyes; and the mothers of Grande Pointe
dropped again into their seats and silently added
theirs.</p>

<p>The next moment all eyes were on Maximian. His
strong figure was mounted on a chair, and he was
making a gentle, commanding gesture with one hand
as he called:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seet down! Seet down, all han&rsquo;!&rdquo; And all
sank down, Bonaventure in a mass of weeping and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
clinging children. &rsquo;Mian too resumed his seat, at the
same time waving to the stranger to speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My friends,&rdquo; said the visitor, rising with alacrity,
&ldquo;I say when a man makes a bargain, he ought to
stick to it!&rdquo; He paused for them&mdash;as many as
could&mdash;to take in the meaning of his English speech,
and, it may be, expecting some demonstration of
approval; but dead silence reigned, all eyes on him
save Bonaventure&rsquo;s and Sidonie&rsquo;s. He began again:</p>

<p>&ldquo;A bargain&rsquo;s a bargain!&rdquo; And Chat-ou&eacute; nodded
approvingly and began to say audibly, &ldquo;Yass;&rdquo; but
&rsquo;Mian thundered out:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Taise toi</i>, Chat-ou&eacute;! Shot op!&rdquo; And the silence
was again complete, while the stranger resumed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was a plain bargain made.&rdquo; He moved
a step forward and laid the matter off on the palm of
his hand. &ldquo;There was to be an examination; the
school was not to know; but if one scholar should
make one mistake the schoolhouse was to be closed
and the schoolmaster sent away. Well, there&rsquo;s been
a mistake made, and I say a bargain&rsquo;s a bargain.&rdquo;
Dead silence still. The speaker looked at &rsquo;Mian.
&ldquo;Do you think they understand me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dey meck out,&rdquo; said &rsquo;Mian, and shut his firm
jaws.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My friends,&rdquo; said the stranger once more, &ldquo;some
people think education&rsquo;s a big thing, and some think
it ain&rsquo;t. Well, sometimes it is and sometimes it ain&rsquo;t.
Now, here&rsquo;s this man&rdquo;&mdash;he pointed down to where
Bonaventure&rsquo;s dishevelled crown was drooping to his
knees&mdash;&ldquo;claims to have taught over thirty of your
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
children to read. Well, what of it? A man can know
how to read, and be just as no account as he was
before. He brags that he&rsquo;s taught them to talk English.
Well, what does that prove? A man <em>might</em>
speak English and starve to death. He claims, I am
told, to have taught some of them to write. But I
know a man in the penitentiary that can write; he
wrote too much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bonaventure had lifted his head and was sitting
with his eyes upon the speaker in close attention. At
this last word he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! sir! too true, too true ah yo&rsquo; words; nevertheless,
their cooelty! &rsquo;Tis not what is print&rsquo; <em>in</em> the
books, but what you learn <em>through</em> the books!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; and so you hadn&rsquo;t never ought to have made
the bargain you made; but, my friends, a bargain&rsquo;s
a bargain, and the teacher&rsquo;s&rdquo;&mdash;He paused invitingly,
and an answer came from the audience. It was
Catou who rose and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Naw, sah. Naw; he don&rsquo;t got to go!&rdquo; But
again &rsquo;Mian thundered:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Taise toi</i>, Catou. Shot op!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say,&rdquo; continued the stranger, &ldquo;the mistake&rsquo;s
been made. <em>Three</em> mistakes have been made!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yass!&rdquo; roared Chat-ou&eacute;, leaping to his feet and
turning upon the assemblage a face fierce with triumph.
Suspense and suspicions were past now; he
was to see his desire on his enemy. But instantly a
dozen men were on their feet&mdash;St. Pierre, Catou,
Bonaventure himself, with a countenance full of pleading
deprecation, and even Claude, flushed with anger.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
&ldquo;Naw, sah! Naw, sah! Waun meesteck?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seet down, all han&rsquo;!&rdquo; yelled &rsquo;Mian; &ldquo;all han&rsquo;
seet dah-oon!&rdquo; Only Chat-ou&eacute; took his seat, glancing
upon the rest with the exultant look of one who
can afford to yield ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The first mistake,&rdquo; resumed the stranger, addressing
himself especially to the risen men still standing,
and pointedly to Catou, &ldquo;the first mistake was in the
kind of bargain you made.&rdquo; He ceased, and passed
his eyes around from one to another until they rested
an instant on the bewildered countenance of Chat-ou&eacute;.
Then he turned again upon the people, who had sat
down, and began to speak with the exultation of a
man that feels his subject lifting him above himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I came out here to show up that man as a fraud.
But what do I find? A poor, unpaid, half-starved
man that loves his thankless work better than his life,
teaching what not one schoolmaster in a thousand can
teach; teaching his whole school four better things
than were ever printed in any school-book,&mdash;how to
study, how to think, how to value knowledge, and
to love one another and mankind. What you&rsquo;d ought
to have done was to agree that such a school should
keep open, and such a teacher should stay, if jest one,
one lone child should answer one single book-question
right! But as I said before, a bargain&rsquo;s a bargain&mdash;Hold
on there! Sit down! You sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t interrupt
me again!&rdquo; Men were standing up on every side.
There was confusion and a loud buzz of voices. &ldquo;The
second mistake,&rdquo; the stranger made haste to cry,
&ldquo;was thinking the teacher gave out that last word
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
right. He gave it wrong! And the third mistake,&rdquo;
he shouted against the rising commotion, &ldquo;was thinking
it was spelt wrong. <em>She spelt it right!</em> And a
bargain&rsquo;s a bargain! The schoolmaster stays!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He could say no more; the rumble of voices suddenly
burst into a cheer. The women and children
laughed and clapped their hands,&mdash;Toutou his feet
also,&mdash;and Bonaventure, flirting the leaves of a spelling
book till he found the place, looked, cried&mdash;&ldquo;In-com-pre-hen-<em>sibility</em>!&rdquo;
wheeled and dashed upon
Sidonie, seized her hands in his as she turned to fly,
and gazed speechlessly upon her, with the tears running
down his face. Feeling a large hand upon his
shoulder, he glanced around and saw &rsquo;Mian pointing
him to his platform and desk. Thither he went. The
stranger had partly restored order. Every one was in
his place. But what a change! What a gay flutter
throughout the old shed! Bonaventure seemed to
have bathed in the fountain of youth. Sidonie, once
more the school&rsquo;s queen-flower, sat calm, with just
a trace of tears adding a subtle something to her
beauty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Chil&rsquo;run, beloved chil&rsquo;run,&rdquo; said Bonaventure,
standing once more by his desk, &ldquo;yo&rsquo; school-teacher
has the blame of the sole mistake; and, sir, gladly,
oh, gladly, sir, would he always have the blame rather
than any of his beloved school-chil&rsquo;run! Sir, I will
boldly ask you&mdash;<em>ah</em> you not the State Sup&rsquo;inten&rsquo;ent
Public Education?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But surely, sir, than a greater?&mdash;Yes, I discover
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
it, though you smile. Chil&rsquo;run&mdash;friends&mdash;not the
State Sup&rsquo;inten&rsquo;ent, but greater!&mdash;Pardon; have yo&rsquo;
chair, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, the examination&rsquo;s over, isn&rsquo;t it? Guess
you&rsquo;d better call it finished, hadn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; He made
the suggestion softly, but Bonaventure answered
aloud:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Figu&rsquo;atively speaking, &rsquo;tis conclude&rsquo;; but&mdash;pardon&mdash;you
mention&rsquo; writing. Shall you paht f&rsquo;om us
not known&mdash;not leaving yo&rsquo; name&mdash;in a copy-book,
for examp&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With pleasure. You do teach writing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I teach writing? To such with desks, yes.
&rsquo;Twould be to all but for the privation of desks. You
perceive how we have here nothing less than a desk
famine. Madelaine! Claude! Sidonie!&mdash;present
copy-book&rsquo;! Sir, do you not think every chile should
be provided a desk?&mdash;Ah! I knew &rsquo;twould be yo&rsquo; verdic&rsquo;.
But how great trouble I have with that subjec&rsquo;!
Me, I think yes; but the parents,&rdquo;&mdash;he looked tenderly
over among them,&mdash;&ldquo;they contend no. Now,
sir, here are three copy-books. Inspect; criticise.
No, commence rather, if you please, with the copy-book
of Madelaine; then <em>p&rsquo;oceed</em> to the copy-book of
Claude, and finally conclude at the copy-book of Sidonie;
thus rising by degrees: good, more good, most
good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How about,&rdquo; asked the stranger, with a smile, as
he turned the leaves, &ldquo;about Toutou and Cr&eacute;biche;
don&rsquo;t they write?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! sir,&rdquo; said Bonaventure, half to the stranger
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
and half to the assemblage, &ldquo;they write, yes; but&mdash;they
ah yet in the pot-hook and chicken-track stage.
And now, chil&rsquo;run, in honor of our eminent friend&rsquo;s
visitation, and of the excellence with which you have
been examine&rsquo;, I p&rsquo;onounce the <em>exhibition</em> finish&rsquo;&mdash;dispensing
with &lsquo;Twink&rsquo;, twink&rsquo; lil stah.&rsquo; And now,
in the book of the best writing scholar in the school&mdash;you,
sir, deciding that intricacy&mdash;shall now be written
the name of the eminent frien&rsquo; of learning hereinbefo&rsquo;
confronting.&mdash;Claude! a new pen!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The stranger made his choice among the books.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Chil&rsquo;run, he has select&rsquo; the book of Sidonie!&rdquo;
Bonaventure reached and swung a chair into place at
his desk. The visitor sat down. Bonaventure stood
over him, gazing down at the hand that poised the pen.
The silence was profound.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Chil&rsquo;run&mdash;sh-sh-sh!&rdquo; said the master, lifting his
left arm but not his eyes. The stranger wrote a single
initial.</p>

<p>&ldquo;G! chil&rsquo;run; G!&mdash;Sir, does it not signify
George?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; murmured the writer; &ldquo;it stands for
George.&rdquo; He wrote another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;W! my chil&rsquo;run; George W!&mdash;Sir, does it not
sig&mdash;<em>My</em> chil&rsquo;run! George Washington! George
Washington, my chil&rsquo;run! George Washington, the
father of his country! My chil&rsquo;run and fellow-citizen&rsquo;
of Gran&rsquo; Point&rsquo;, he is nominated for George Washington,
the father of his country! Sir, ah you not a
relation?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I really can&rsquo;t tell you,&rdquo; said the writer, with a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
calm smile. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always been too busy to look it
up.&rdquo; He finished his signature as he talked. Bonaventure
bent over it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tar-box. Chil&rsquo;run and friends and fellow-citizen&rsquo;,
I have the p&rsquo;oudness to int&rsquo;oduce you the hono&rsquo;able
George Washington Tarbox! And now the exhibition
is dismiss&rsquo;; but stop! Sir, if some&mdash;aw all&mdash;desire
gratefully to shake hand&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should feel honored.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Attention, everybody! Make rank! Everybody
by two by two, the school-chil&rsquo;run coming last,&mdash;Claude
and Sidonie resting till the end,&mdash;pass &rsquo;round&mdash;shake
hand&rsquo;&mdash;walk out&mdash;similah a fu-nial.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So came, shook hands, and passed out and to their
simple homes, the manhood, motherhood, maidenhood,
childhood of Grande Pointe, not knowing that before
many days every household in the village was to be a
subscriber to the &ldquo;Album of Universal Information.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One of the last of the householders was Chat-ou&eacute;.
But when he grasped the honored hand, he also held
it, fixing upon its owner a generous and somewhat
bacchanalian smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a fool, but <em>I</em> know. You been put op a jawb
on me. Dass four, five days now I been try to meck
out what dat niggah at Belle Alliance holla to me when
I gallop down de road.&rdquo; (Chat-ou&eacute;&rsquo;s English had been
acquired from negroes in the sugar-house, and was like
theirs.) &ldquo;He been braggin&rsquo; dat day befo&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;turning
to Bonaventure&mdash;&ldquo;how &rsquo;twas him show you de
road to Gran&rsquo; Point&rsquo; las&rsquo; year; and so I git mad and
tell him, me,&rdquo; addressing the stranger again, &ldquo;how
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
we goin&rsquo; git school shot op. Well, dat night I mit
him comin&rsquo; fum Gran&rsquo; Point&rsquo; and he hol&rsquo; at me. I
been try evva since meck out what he say. Yass.
An&rsquo; I <em>jis</em> meck it out! He say, &lsquo;Watch out, watch
out, &rsquo;Mian Roussel and dat book-fellah dawn&rsquo;t put op
jawb on <em>you</em>.&rsquo; Well, I&rsquo;m a fool, but I know. You put
op jawb on me; I know. But dass all right&mdash;<em>I don&rsquo;t
take no book.</em>&rdquo; He laughed with the rest, scratched
his tipsy head, and backed out through the <i>pieux</i>.</p>

<p>Only a fairy number remained, grouped around
the honorable Tarbox. They were St. Pierre, Bonaventure,&mdash;Maximian
detaining a middle-aged pair,
Sidonie&rsquo;s timorous guardians,&mdash;and two others, who
held back, still waiting to shake hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Claude,&rdquo; cried Bonaventure; &ldquo;Sidonie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They came. Claude shook hands and stepped inside.
Sidonie, with eyes on the ground, put forth her hand.
The honored guest held it lingeringly, and the ceremonies
were at an end.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said &rsquo;Mian, beckoning away the great G.
W.&rsquo;s probable relative. They passed out together.
&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; he repeated, looking back and beckoning
again; &ldquo;walk een! all han&rsquo;! walk een house!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The guardian pair followed, hand in hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Claude,&rdquo; said Bonaventure tenderly; but&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Claude,&rdquo; more firmly said St. Pierre.</p>

<p>The boy looked for one instant from the master&rsquo;s
face to Sidonie&rsquo;s; then turned, grasped his father&rsquo;s
hand, and followed the others.</p>

<p>A blaze of light filled Bonaventure&rsquo;s heart. He
turned to Sidonie to give his hand&mdash;both her hands
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
were clasped upon each other, and they only tightened.
But their eyes met&mdash;ah! those Acadian maidens, they
do it all with their eyes!&mdash;and lover and maiden
passed out and walked forth side by side. They are
going that way still, only&mdash;with hands joined.</p>

<h2><a name="PART_III_CHAP_I" id="PART_III_CHAP_I"></a>AU LARGE.</h2>



<h3 style="padding-top: 3em;">CHAPTER I.</h3>

<h3>THE POT-HUNTER.</h3>


<p>The sun was just rising, as a man stepped from his
slender dug-out and drew half its length out upon the
oozy bank of a pretty bayou. Before him, as he
turned away from the water, a small gray railway-platform
and frame station-house, drowsing on long
legs in the mud and water, were still veiled in the
translucent shade of the deep cypress swamp, whose
long moss drapings almost overhung them on the side
next the brightening dawn. The solemn gray festoons
did overhang the farthest two or three of a few flimsy
wooden houses and a saw-mill with its lumber, logs,
and sawdust, its cold furnace and idle engine.</p>

<p>As with gun and game this man mounted by a short,
rude ladder to firmer footing on the platform, a negro,
who sat fishing for his breakfast on the bank a few
yards up the stream, where it bent from the north and
west, slowly lifted his eyes, noted that the other was
a white man, an Acadian, and brought his gaze back
again to hook and line.</p>

<p>He had made out these facts by the man&rsquo;s shape
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
and dress, for the face was in shade. The day, I
say, was still in its genesis. The waters that slid so
languidly between the two silent men as not to crook
one line of the station-house&rsquo;s image inverted in their
clear dark depths, had not yet caught a beam upon
their whitest water-lily, nor yet upon their tallest bulrush;
but the tops of the giant cypresses were green
and luminous, and as the Acadian glanced abroad
westward, in the open sky far out over the vast marshy
breadths of the &ldquo;shaking prairie,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> two still clouds,
whose under surfaces were yet dusky and pink, sparkled
on their sunward edges like a frosted fleece. You
could not have told whether the Acadian saw the black
man or not. His dog, soiled and wet, stood beside
his knee, pricked his ears for a moment at sight of the
negro, and then dropped them.</p>

<p>It was September. The comfortable air could only
near by be seen to stir the tops of the high reeds whose
crowding myriads stretched away south, west, and
north, an open sea of green, its immense distances
relieved here and there by strips of swamp forest
tinged with their peculiar purple haze. Eastward the
railroad&rsquo;s long causeway and telegraph-poles narrowed
on the view through its wide axe-hewn lane in the overtowering
swamp. New Orleans, sixty miles or more
away, was in that direction. Westward, rails, causeway,
and telegraph, tapered away again across the
illimitable hidden quicksands of the &ldquo;trembling
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
prairie&rdquo; till the green disguise of reeds and rushes
closed in upon the attenuated line, and only a small
notch in a far strip of woods showed where it still led
on toward Texas. Behind the Acadian the smoke
of woman&rsquo;s early industry began to curl from two or
three low chimneys.</p>

<p>But his eye lingered in the north. He stood with
his dog curled at his feet beside a bunch of egrets,&mdash;killed
for their plumage,&mdash;the butt of his long fowling-piece
resting on the platform, and the arm half outstretched
whose hand grasped the barrels near the
muzzle. The hand, toil-hardened and weather-browned,
showed, withal, antiquity of race. His feet were in
rough muddy brogans, but even so they were smallish
and shapely. His garments were coarse, but there
were no tatters anywhere. He wore a wide Campeachy
hat. His brown hair was too long, but it was
fine. His eyes, too, were brown, and, between brief
moments of alertness, sedate. Sun and wind had
darkened his face, and his pale brown beard curled
meagre and untrimmed on a cheek and chin that in
forty years had never felt a razor.</p>

<p>Some miles away in the direction in which he was
looking, the broadening sunlight had struck and brightened
the single red lug-sail of a boat whose unseen
hull, for all the eye could see, was coming across
the green land on a dry keel. But the bayou, hidden
in the tall rushes, was its highway; for suddenly the
canvas was black as it turned its shady side, and soon
was red again as another change of direction caught
the sunbeams upon its tense width and showed that,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
with much more wind out there than it would find by
and by in here under the lee of the swamp, it was following
the unseen meanderings of the stream. Presently
it reached a more open space where a stretch of
the water lay shining in the distant view. Here the
boat itself came into sight, showed its bunch of some
half-dozen passengers for a minute or two, and vanished
again, leaving only its slanting red sail skimming
nautilus-like over the vast breezy expanse.</p>

<p>Yet more than two hours later the boat&rsquo;s one blue-shirted,
barefoot Sicilian sailor in red worsted cap had
with one oar at the stern just turned her drifting form
into the glassy calm by the railway-station, tossed her
anchor ashore, and was still busy with small matters
of boat-keeping, while his five passengers clambered to
the platform.</p>

<p>The place showed somewhat more movement now.
The negro had long ago wound his line upon its crooked
pole, gathered up his stiffened fishes from the bank,
thrust them into the pockets of his shamelessly ragged
trousers, and was gone to his hut in the underbrush.
But the few amphibious households round about were
passing out and in at the half-idle tasks of their slow
daily life, and a young white man was bustling around,
now into the station and now out again upon the platform,
with authority in his frown and a pencil and two
matches behind his ear. It was Monday. Two or
three shabby negroes with broad, collapsed, glazed
leather travelling-bags of the old carpet-sack pattern
dragged their formless feet about, waiting to take the
train for the next station to hire out there as rice
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
harvesters, and one, with his back turned, leaned motionless
against an open window gazing in upon the ticking
telegraph instruments. A black woman in blue cotton
gown, red-and-yellow Madras turban, and some sportsman&rsquo;s
cast-off hunting-shoes minus the shoe-strings,
crouched against the wall. Beside her stood her
shapely mulatto daughter, with head-covering of white
cotton cloth, in which female instinct had discovered
the lines of grace and disposed them after the folds of
the Egyptian fellah head&mdash;dress. A portly white man,
with decided polish in his commanding air, evidently a
sugar-planter from the Mississippi &ldquo;coast&rdquo; ten miles
northward, moved about in spurred boots, and put
personal questions to the negroes, calling them &ldquo;boys,&rdquo;
and the mulattress, &ldquo;girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The pot-hunter was still among them; or rather,
he had drawn apart from the rest, and stood at the
platform&rsquo;s far end, leaning on his gun, an innocent,
wild-animal look in his restless eyes, and a slumberous
agility revealed in his strong, supple loins. The
station-agent went to him, and with abrupt questions
and assertions, to which the man replied in low, grave
monosyllables, bought his game,&mdash;as he might have
done two hours before, but&mdash;an Acadian can wait.
There was some trouble to make exact change, and the
agent, saying &ldquo;Hold on, I&rsquo;ll fix it,&rdquo; went into the
station just as the group from the Sicilian&rsquo;s boat
reached the platform. The agent came bustling out
again with his eyes on his palm, counting small silver.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; But he spoke to the empty air. He
glanced about with an offended frown.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
&ldquo;Achille!&rdquo; There was no reply. He turned to
one of the negroes: &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s that &rsquo;Cajun?&rdquo; Nobody
knew. Down where his canoe had lain, tiny rillets
of muddy water were still running into its imprint left
in the mire; but canoe, dog, and man had vanished
into the rank undergrowth of the swamp.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<h3><a name="PART_III_CHAP_II" id="PART_III_CHAP_II"></a>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<h3>CLAUDE.</h3>


<p>Of the party that had come in the Sicilian&rsquo;s boat
four were men and one a young woman. She was
pretty; so pretty, and of such restful sweetness of
countenance, that the homespun garb, the brand-new
creaking gaiters, and a hat that I dare not describe
were nothing against her. Her large, soft, dark eyes,
more sweetly but not less plainly than the attire, confessed
her a denizen of the woods.</p>

<p>Not so the man who seemed to be her husband.
His dress was rustic enough; and yet you would have
seen at once that it was not the outward circumstance,
but an inward singularity, that had made him and
must always keep him a stranger to the ordinary ways
of men. There was an emotional exaltation in his face
as he hastily led his companions with military directness
to the ticket window. Two others of the men
were evidently father and son, the son barely twenty
years of age, the parent certainly not twice as old;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
and the last of the group was a strong, sluggish man
of years somewhat near, but under, fifty.</p>

<p>They bought but one ticket; but, as one may say,
they all bought it, the youngest extricating its price
with difficulty from the knotted corner of his red handkerchief,
and the long, thin hand of the leader making
the purchase, while the eyes of the others followed
every movement with unconscious absorption.</p>

<p>The same unemotional attentiveness was in their
forms as their slow feet drifted here and there always
after the one leader, their eyes on his demonstrative
hands, and their ears drinking in his discourse. He
showed them the rails of the track, how smooth they
were, how they rested on their cross-ties, and how they
were spiked in place always the same width apart.
They crowded close about him at the telegraph-window
while he interpreted with unconscious originality the
wonders of electricity. Their eyes rose slowly from
the window up and out along the ascending wires to
where they mounted the poles and eastward and westward
leaped away sinking and rising from insulator to
insulator. One of the party pointed at these green
dots of glass and murmured a question, and the leader&rsquo;s
wife laid her small hand softly upon his arm to
check the energy of his utterance as he said, audibly
to all on the platform, and with a strong French
accent:</p>

<p>&ldquo;They?&mdash;are there lest the heat of the telegraph
fluid inflame the post-es!&rdquo; He laid his own hand tenderly
upon his wife&rsquo;s in response to its warning pressure,
yet turned to the sugar-planter and asked:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
&ldquo;Sir, pardon; do I not explain truly?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The planter, with restrained smile, was about to
reply, when some one called, &ldquo;There she comes!&rdquo;
and every eye was turned to the east.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Truly!&rdquo; exclaimed the inquirer, in a voice made
rich with emotion. &ldquo;Truly, she comes! She comes!
The iron horse, though they call him &lsquo;she&rsquo;!&rdquo; He
turned to the planter&mdash;&ldquo;Ah! sir, why say they thus
many or thus many horse-power, when truly&rdquo;&mdash;his
finger-tip pattered upon his temple&mdash;&ldquo;truly it is mind-power!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The planter, smiling decorously, turned away, and
the speaker looked again down the long vacant track
to where the small dark focus of every one&rsquo;s attention
was growing on the sight. He spoke again, in lower
voice but with larger emotion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mind-power! thought-power! knowledge-power!
learning and thinking power!&rdquo; He caught his wife&rsquo;s
arm. &ldquo;See! see, Sidonie, my dear! See her enhancing
in magnitude so fastly approaching!&rdquo; As he
spoke a puff of white vapor lifted from the object and
spread out against the blue, the sunbeams turned it to
silver and pearl, and a moment later came the far-away,
long, wild scream of the locomotive.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Retire!&rdquo; exclaimed the husband, drawing back
all his gazing companions at once. &ldquo;Retire! retire!
the whisttel is to signify warning to retire from too
close the edge of the gal&eacute;rie! There! rest at this
point. &rsquo;Tis far enough. Now, each and all resolve
to stand and shrink not whilst that iron mare, eating
coal, drinking hot water, and spitting fire, shall seem,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
but falsely, threatening to come on the platform. Ah!
Claude!&rdquo; he cried to the youngest of the group, &ldquo;now
shall you behold what I have told you&mdash;that vast
am-azement of civilize-ation anni-<em>high</em>-lating space and
also time at the tune of twenty miles the hour!&rdquo; He
wheeled upon the planter&mdash;&ldquo;Sir, do I exaggerate?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forty miles,&rdquo; replied the planter; &ldquo;sometimes
fifty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Friends,&mdash;confirmated! more than twicefold confirmated.
Forty, sometimes fifty! Thou heardest it,
Maximian Roussel! Not from me, but from the gentleman
himself! Forty, sometimes fifty! Such the
march, the forward march of civilize-ation!&rdquo;</p>

<p>His words were cut short by the unearthly neigh of
the engine. Sidonie smote herself backward against
her husband.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, Sidonie, fear thou nothing! Remember,
dear Sidonie, thy promise of self-control! Stand
boldly still, St. Pierre; both father and son, stand.&rdquo;
The speaker was unheard. Hissing, clanging, thundering,
and shaking the earth, the engine and train
loomed up to the platform and stopped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; cried Bonaventure Deschamps; &ldquo;lose no
moment, dear friends. Tide and time&mdash;even less the
railroad&mdash;wait for nobody. Claude, remember; give
your ticket of passage to none save the conductor only.
&rsquo;Tis print&rsquo; in letter&rsquo; of gold on front his cap&mdash;&lsquo;Conductor&rsquo;&mdash;Stop!
he is here.&mdash;Sir, this young man,
inexperienced, is taking passage for&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shoot him aboard,&rdquo; replied a uniformed man, and
walked on without a pause. Claude moved toward
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
the train. Bonaventure seized him by both arms and
gazed on him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Claude St. Pierre! Claude, my boy, pride of
Grande Pointe, second only with Sidonie, farewell!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tears leaped into the eyes of both. Bonaventure
snatched Claude to his arms and kissed him. It was
less than nothing to him that every eye on and off the
train was on them. He relaxed his grasp. &ldquo;Sidonie!
tell him farewell!&mdash;ah! nay! shake not hands only!
Kiss her, Claude! Kiss him, my own Sidonie, kiss
him farewell!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was done. Claude blushed red, and Sidonie
stepped back, wiping her eyes. Maximian moved into
the void, and smiling gave his hand to the young
adventurer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Adjieu, Claude.&rdquo; He waved a hand awkwardly.
&ldquo;Teck care you&rsquo;seff,&rdquo; and dropped the hand audibly
against his thigh.</p>

<p>Claude&rsquo;s eye sought his father. St. Pierre pressed
forward, laid his right hand upon his son&rsquo;s shoulder,
and gazed into his face. His voice was low and
husky. He smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Claude,&rdquo;&mdash;tears rose in his eyes, but he swallowed
them down,&mdash;&ldquo;Claude,&mdash;my baby,&rdquo;&mdash;and
the flood came. The engine-bell rang. The conductor
gave the warning word, the youth leaped upon his
father&rsquo;s neck. St. Pierre thrust him off, caught his
two cheeks between fluttering palms and kissed him
violently; the train moved, the young man leaped
aboard, the blue uniforms disappeared, save one on
the rear platform, the bell ceased, the gliding mass
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
shrunk and dwindled away, the rails clicked more and
more softly, the tearful group drew closer together as
they gazed after the now-unheard train. It melted to
a point and disappeared, the stillness of forest and
prairie fell again upon the place, the soaring sun
shone down, and Claude St. Pierre was gone to seek
his fortune.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<h3><a name="PART_III_CHAP_III" id="PART_III_CHAP_III"></a>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<h3>THE TAVERN FIRESIDE.</h3>


<p>I call to mind a certain wild, dark night in November.
St. Pierre lay under his palmetto thatch in the
forest behind Grande Pointe, and could not sleep for
listening to the wind, and wondering where his son was,
in that wild Texas norther. On the Mississippi a
steamer, upward bound, that had whistled to land at
Belmont or Belle Alliance plantation, seemed to be
staying there afraid to venture away. Miles southward
beyond the river and the lands on that side,
Lake des Allemands was combing with the tempest
and hissing with the rain. Still farther away, on the
little bayou and at the railway-station in the edge of
the swamp that we already know, and westward over
the prairie where Claude had vanished into the world,
all life was hidden and mute. And farther still, leagues
and leagues away, the mad tempest was riding the white-caps
in Berwick&rsquo;s Bay and Grande Lake; and yet beyond,
beyond New Iberia, and up by Carancro, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
around again by St. Martinville, Breaux Bridge, Grand
Coteau, and Opelousas, and down once more across
the prairies of Vermilion, the marshes about C&ocirc;te
Blanche Bay, and the islands in the Gulf, it came
bounding, screaming, and buffeting. And all the way
across that open sweep from Mermentau to C&ocirc;te Gel&eacute;e
it was tearing the rain to mist and freezing it wherever
it fell, only lulling and warming a little about Joseph
Jefferson&rsquo;s Island, as if that prank were too mean a
trick to play upon his orange-groves.</p>

<p>In Vermilionville the wind came around every corner
piercing and pinching to the bone. The walking was
slippery; and though it was still early bedtime and
the ruddy lamp-light filled the wet panes of some
window every here and there, scarce a soul was stirring
without, on horse or afoot, to be guided by its kindly
glow.</p>

<p>At the corner of two streets quite away from the
court-house square, a white frame tavern, with a wooden
Greek porch filling its whole two-story front and a
balcony built within the porch at the second-story
windows in oddest fashion, was glowing with hospitable
firelight. It was not nearly the largest inn of the
place, nor the oldest, nor the newest, nor the most
accessible. There was no clink of glass there. Yet
in this, only third year of its present management, it
was the place where those who knew best always put
up.</p>

<p>Around the waiting-room fire this evening sat a
goodly semicircle of men,&mdash;commercial travellers.
Some of them were quite dry and comfortable, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
wore an air of superior fortune over others whose
shoes and lower garments sent out more or less steam
and odor toward the open fireplace. Several were
smoking. One who neither smoked nor steamed stood
with his back to the fire and the skirts of his coat lifted
forward on his wrists. He was a rather short, slight,
nervy man, about thirty years of age, with a wide pink
baldness running so far back from his prominent temples
and forehead that when he tipped his face toward the
blue joists overhead, enjoying the fatigue of a well-filled
day, his polished skull sent back the firelight
brilliantly. There was a light skirmish of conversation
going on, in which he took no part. No one
seemed really acquainted with another. Presently a
man sitting next on the left of him put away a quill
toothpick in his watch-pocket, looked up into the face
of the standing man, and said, with a faint smile:</p>

<p>&ldquo;That job&rsquo;s done!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With friendly gravity the other looked down and
replied, &ldquo;I never use a quill toothpick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the one who sat, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s bad. Still I
do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; continued the other,&mdash;&ldquo;nothing harder
than a sharpened white-pine match should ever go
between the teeth. Brush thoroughly but not violently
once or twice daily with a moderately stiff brush dipped
in soft water into which has been dropped a few drops
of the tincture of myrrh. A brush of badger&rsquo;s hair is
best. If tartar accumulates, have it removed by a
dentist. Do not bite thread or crack nuts with the
teeth, or use the teeth for other purposes than those
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
for which nature designed them.&rdquo; He bent toward
his hearer with a smile of irresistible sweetness, drew
his lips away from his gums, snapped his teeth together
loudly twice or thrice, and smiled again, modestly. The
other man sought defence in buoyancy of manner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right you are!&rdquo; he chirruped. He reached up to
his adviser&rsquo;s blue and crimson neck-scarf, and laid his
finger and thumb upon a large, solitary pear-shaped
pearl. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re like me; you believe in the real
thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; said the pearl&rsquo;s owner; &ldquo;and I like people
that like the real thing. A pearl of the first water <em>is</em>
real. There&rsquo;s no sham there; no deception&mdash;except
the iridescence, which is, as you doubtless know, an
optical illusion attributable to the intervention of rays
of light reflected from microscopic corrugations of the
nacreous surface. But for that our eye is to blame,
not the pearl. See?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The seated man did not reply; but another man on
the speaker&rsquo;s right, a large man, widest at the waist,
leaned across the arm of his chair to scrutinize the
jewel. Its owner turned his throat for the inspection,
despite a certain grumness and crocodilian aggressiveness
in the man&rsquo;s interest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I like a diamond, myself,&rdquo; said the new on-looker,
dropped back in his chair, and met the eyes of the
pearl&rsquo;s owner with a heavy glance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tastes differ,&rdquo; kindly responded the wearer of the
pearl. &ldquo;Are you acquainted with the language of
gems?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The big-waisted man gave a negative grunt, and spat
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
bravely into the fire. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t know gems could
talk,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They do not talk, they speak,&rdquo; responded their
serene interpreter. The company in general noticed
that, with all his amiability of tone and manner, his
mild eyes held the big-waisted man with an uncomfortable
steadiness. &ldquo;They speak not to the ear, but to
the eye and to the thought:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Thought is deeper than all speech;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Feeling deeper than all thought;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Souls to souls can never teach<br /></span>
<span class="i1">What unto themselves was taught.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>The speaker&rsquo;s victim writhed, but the riveted gaze
and an uplifted finger pinioned him. &ldquo;You should
know&mdash;every one should know&mdash;the language of
gems. There is a language of flowers:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;To me the meanest flower that blows can give<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>But the language of gems is as much more important
than that of flowers as the imperishable gem is itself
more enduring than the withering, the evanescent
blossom. A gentleman may not with safety present to
a lady a gem of whose accompanying sentiment he is
ignorant. But with the language of gems understood
between them, how could a sentiment be more exquisitely
or more acceptably expressed than by the gift
of a costly gem uttering that sentiment with an unspoken
eloquence! Did you but know the language
of gems, your choice would not be the diamond.
&lsquo;Diamond me no diamonds,&rsquo; emblems of pride&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Pride in their port, defiance in their eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I see the lords of humankind pass by.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Your choice would have been the pearl, symbol of
modest loveliness.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Full many a gem of purest ray serene<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dark, unfathomed caves of ocean bear;&rsquo;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Hath whispered, &ldquo;The angels protect thee from sin.&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>The speaker ceased, with his glance hovering caressingly
over the little trembler with fluttering wing, that
is, the big-waisted man. The company sat in listening
expectancy; and the big-waisted man, whose eyes had
long ago sought refuge in the fire, lifted them and said,
satirically, &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; at the same time trying to buy
his way out with a smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your turn,&rdquo; quickly responded the jewel&rsquo;s
owner, with something droll in his manner that made
the company laugh at the other&rsquo;s expense. The big-waisted
man kindled, then smiled again, and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was that emblem of modest loveliness give&rsquo; to you
symbolically, or did you present it to yourself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I took it for a debt,&rdquo; replied the wearer, bowing
joyously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;Well, I s&rsquo;pose it was
either that or her furniture?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks, yes.&rdquo; There was a pause, and then the
pearl&rsquo;s owner spoke on. &ldquo;Strange fact. That was
years ago. And yet&rdquo;&mdash;he fondled his gem with thumb
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
and finger and tender glance&mdash;&ldquo;you&rsquo;re the first man
I&rsquo;ve met to whom I could sincerely and symbolically
present it, and you don&rsquo;t want it. I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said the big-waisted man, glaring at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; responded the pearl&rsquo;s owner. A smile
went round, and the company sat looking into the fire.
Outside the wind growled and scolded, shook and
slapped the house, and thrashed it with the rain. A
man sitting against the chimney said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;If this storm keeps on six hours longer I reduce
my estimate of the cotton-crop sixty-five thousand
bales.&rdquo; But no one responded; and as the importance
died out of his face he dropped his gaze into the fire
with a pretence of deep meditation. Presently another,
a good-looking young fellow, said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, gents, I never cared much for jewelry. But
I like a nice scarf-pin; it&rsquo;s nobby. And I like a handsome
seal-ring.&rdquo; He drew one from a rather chubby
finger, and passed it to his next neighbor, following it
with his eyes, and adding: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s said to be a real
intaglio. But&mdash;now, one thing I don&rsquo;t like, that&rsquo;s to
see a lady wear a quantity of diamond rings outside of
her glove, and heavy gold chains, and&rdquo;&mdash;He was
interrupted. A long man, with legs stiffened out to
the fire, lifted a cigar between two fingers, sent a soft
jet of smoke into the air, and began monotonously:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Chains on a Southern woman? Chains?&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>I know the lady that wrote that piece.&rdquo; He suddenly
gathered himself up for some large effort. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
recite it as she used to, but&rdquo;&mdash;And to the joy of
all he was interrupted.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said one, throwing a cigarette stump
into the fire, &ldquo;that brings up the subject of the war.
By the by, do you know what that war cost the Government
of the United States?&rdquo; He glanced from
one to another until his eye reached the wearer of the
pearl, who had faced about, and stood now, with the
jewel glistening in the firelight, and who promptly
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; how much?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the first questioner with sudden caution,
&ldquo;I may be mistaken, but I&rsquo;ve heard that it cost
six&mdash;I think they say six&mdash;billion dollars. Didn&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It did,&rdquo; replied the other, with a smile of friendly
commendation; &ldquo;it cost six billion, one hundred and
eighty-nine million, nine hundred and twenty-nine
thousand, nine hundred and eight dollars. The largest
item is interest; one billion, seven hundred and one
million, two hundred and fifty-six thousand, one hundred
and ninety-eight dollars, forty-two cents. The
next largest, the pay of troops; the next, clothing
the army. If there&rsquo;s any item of the war&rsquo;s expenses
you would like to know, ask me. Capturing president
Confederate States&mdash;ninety-seven thousand and thirty-one
dollars, three cents.&rdquo; The speaker&rsquo;s manner grew
almost gay. The other smiled defensively, and
responded:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got a good memory for sta-stistics. I
haven&rsquo;t; and yet I always did like sta-stistics. I&rsquo;m
no sta-stitian, and yet if I had the time sta-stistics
would be my favorite study; I s&rsquo;pose it&rsquo;s yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
The wearer of the pearl shook his head. &ldquo;No.
But I like it. I like the style of mind that likes it.&rdquo;
The two bowed with playful graciousness to each
other. &ldquo;Yes, I do. And I&rsquo;ve studied it, some little.
I can tell you the best time of every celebrated trotter
in this country; the quickest trip a steamer ever made
between Queenstown and New York, New York and
Queenstown, New Orleans and New York; the greatest
speed ever made on a railroad or by a yacht,
pedestrian, carrier-pigeon, or defaulting cashier; the
rate of postage to every foreign country; the excess
of women over men in every State of the Union so
afflicted&mdash;or blessed, according to how you look at
it; the number of volumes in each of the world&rsquo;s ten
largest libraries; the salary of every officer of the
United-States Government; the average duration of
life in a man, elephant, lion, horse, anaconda, tortoise,
camel, rabbit, ass, etcetera-etcetera; the age of every
crowned head in Europe; each State&rsquo;s legal and commercial
rate of interest; and how long it takes a healthy
boy to digest apples, baked beans, cabbage, dates,
eggs, fish, green corn, h, i, j, k, l-m-n-o-p, quinces,
rice, shrimps, tripe, veal, yams, and any thing you can
cook commencing with z. It&rsquo;s a fascinating study.
But it&rsquo;s not my favorite.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I love to study human nature. That&rsquo;s my favorite
study! The art of reading the inner human nature by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
the outer aspect is of immeasurable interest and boundless
practical value, and the man who can practise it
skilfully and apply it sagaciously is on the high road
to fortune, and why? Because to know it thoroughly
is to know whom to trust and how far; to select wisely
a friend, a confidant, a partner in any enterprise; to
shun the untrustworthy, to anticipate and turn to our
personal advantage the merits, faults, and deficiencies
of all, and to evolve from their character such practical
results as we may choose for our own ends; but a
thorough knowledge is attained only by incessant observation
and long practice; like music, it demands
a special talent possessed by different individuals in
variable quantity or not at all. You, gentlemen, all
are, what I am not, commercial tourists. Before you
I must be modest. You, each of you, have been
chosen from surrounding hundreds or thousands for
your superior ability, natural or acquired, to scan the
human face and form and know whereof you see. I
look you in the eye&mdash;you look me in the eye&mdash;for
the eye, though it does not tell all, tells much&mdash;it
is the key of character&mdash;it has been called the mirror
of the soul&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;And looks commercing with the skies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy rapt soul sitting in thine eyes.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>And so looking you read me. You say to yourself,
&lsquo;There&rsquo;s a man with no concealments, yet who speaks
not till he&rsquo;s spoken to; knows when to stop, and
stops.&rsquo; You note my pale eyebrows, my slightly
prominent and pointed chin, somewhat over-sized
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
mouth; small, well-spread ears, faintly aquiline nose;
fine, thin, blonde hair, a depression in the skull where
the bump of self-conceit ought to be, and you say, &lsquo;A
man that knows his talents without being vain of them;
who not only minds his own business, but loves it, and
who in that business, be it buggy-whips or be it washine,
or be it something far nobler,&rsquo;&mdash;which, let me
say modestly, it is,&mdash;&lsquo;simply goes to the head of the
class and stays there.&rsquo; Yes, sirs, if I say that reading
the human countenance is one of my accomplishments,
I am diffidently mindful that in this company, I, myself,
am read, perused; no other probably so well read&mdash;I
mean so exhaustively perused. For there is one thing
about me, gentlemen, if you&rsquo;ll allow me to say it, I&rsquo;m
short metre, large print, and open to the public seven
days in the week. And yet you probably all make one
mistake about me: you take me for the alumni of some
university. Not so. I&rsquo;m a self-made man. I made
myself; and considering that I&rsquo;m the first man I ever
made, I think&mdash;pardon the seeming egotism&mdash;I think
I&rsquo;ve done well. A few years ago there dwelt in humble
obscurity among the granite hills of New England,
earning his bread by the sweat of his brow upon
his father&rsquo;s farm, a youth to fortune and to fame
unknown. But one day a voice within him said,
&lsquo;Tarbox&rsquo;&mdash;George W.,&mdash;namesake of the man who
never told a lie,&mdash;&lsquo;do you want to succeed in life?
Then leave the production of tobacco and cider to unambitious
age, and find that business wherein you can
always give a man ten times as much for his dollar as
his dollar is worth.&rsquo; The meaning was plain, and from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
that time forth young Tarbox aspired to become a
book-agent. &rsquo;Twas not long ere he, like</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Young Harry Bluff, left his friends and his home,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his dear native land, o&rsquo;er the wide world to roam.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Books became his line, and full soon he was the head
of the line. And why? Was it because in the first
short twelve months of his career he sold, delivered,
and got the money for, 5107 copies of &lsquo;Mend-me-at-Home&rsquo;?
No. Was it, then, because three years later
he sold in one year, with no other assistance than a
man to drive the horse and wagon, hold the blackboard,
and hand out the books, 10,003 copies of &lsquo;Rapid &rsquo;Rithmetic&rsquo;?
It was not. Was it, then, because in 1878,
reading aright the public mind, he said to his publishers,
whose confidence in him was unbounded, &lsquo;It
ain&rsquo;t &ldquo;Mend-me-at-Home&rdquo; the people want most, nor
&ldquo;Rapid &rsquo;Rithmetic,&rdquo; nor &ldquo;Heal Thyself,&rdquo; nor &ldquo;I
meet the Emergency,&rdquo; nor the &ldquo;Bouquet of Poetry
and Song.&rdquo; What they want is all these in one.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Abridged?&rsquo;
said the publishers. &lsquo;Enlarged!&rsquo; said
young Tarbox,&mdash;&lsquo;enlarged and copiously illustrated,
complete in one volume, price, cloth, three dollars,
sheep four, half morocco, gilt edges, five; real value
to the subscriber, two hundred and fifty; title, &ldquo;The
Album of Universal Information; author, G. W. Tarbox;
editor, G. W. T.; agent for the United States,
the Canadas, and Mexico, G. W. Tarbox,&rdquo; that is to
say, myself.&rsquo; That, gentlemen, is the reason I stand
at the head of my line; not merely because on every
copy sold I make an author&rsquo;s as well as a solicitor&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
margin; but because, being the author, I know whereof
I sell. A man that&rsquo;s got my book has got a college
education; and when a man taps me,&mdash;for, gentlemen,
I never spout until I&rsquo;m tapped,&mdash;and information
bursts from me like water from a street hydrant,
and he comes to find out that every thing I tell is in
that wonderful book, and that every thing that is
in that wonderful book I can tell, he wants to own
a copy; and when I tell him I can&rsquo;t spare my sample
copy, but I&rsquo;ll take his subscription, he smiles gratefully&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>A cold, wet blast, rushing into the room from the
hall, betrayed the opening of the front door. The door
was shut again, and a well-formed, muscular young
man who had entered stood in the parlor doorway
lifting his hat from his head, shaking the rain from it,
and looking at it with amused diffidence. Mr. Tarbox
turned about once more with his back to the fire, gave
the figure a quick glance of scrutiny, then a second
and longer one, and then dropped his eyes to the floor.
The big-waisted man shifted his chair, tipped it back,
and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;He smiles gratefully, you say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And subscribes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he&rsquo;s got any sense,&rdquo; Mr. Tarbox replied in a
pre-occupied tone. His eyes were on the young man
who still stood in the door. This person must have
reached the house in some covered conveyance. Even
his boot-tops were dry or nearly so. He was rather
pleasing to see; of good stature, his clothing cheap.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
A dark-blue flannel sack of the ready-made sort hung
on him not too well. Light as the garment was, he
showed no sign that he felt the penetrating cold out of
which he had just come. His throat and beardless
face had the good brown of outdoor life, his broad
chest strained the two buttons of his sack, his head
was well-poised, his feet were shapely, and but for
somewhat too much roundness about the shoulder-blades,
noticeable in the side view as he carefully stood
a long, queer package that was not buggy-whips
against the hat-rack, it would have been fair to pronounce
him an athlete.</p>

<p>The eyes of the fireside group were turned toward
him; but not upon him. They rested on a girl of
sixteen who had come down the hall, and was standing
before the new-comer just beyond the door. The
registry-book was just there on a desk in the hall. She
stood with a freshly dipped pen in her hand, ignoring
the gaze from the fireside with a faintly overdone
calmness of face. The new guest came forward, and,
in a manner that showed slender acquaintance with the
operation, slowly registered his name and address.</p>

<p>He did it with such pains-taking, that, upside down
as the writing was, she read it as he wrote. As the
Christian name appeared, her perfunctory glance became
attention. As the surname followed, the attention
became interest and recognition. And as the
address was added, Mr. Tarbox detected pleasure dancing
behind the long fringe of her discreet eyes, and
marked their stolen glance of quick inspection upon the
short, dark locks and strong young form still bent over
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
the last strokes of the writing. But when he straightened
up, carefully shut the book, and fixed his brown
eyes upon hers in guileless expectation of instructions,
he saw nothing to indicate that he was not the entire
stranger that she was to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You done had sopper?&rdquo; she asked. The uncommon
kindness of such a question at such an hour of a
tavern&rsquo;s evening was lost on the young man&rsquo;s obvious
inexperience, and as one schooled to the hap-hazard
of forest and field he merely replied:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Naw, I didn&rsquo; had any.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl turned&mdash;what a wealth of black hair she
had!&mdash;and disappeared as she moved away along the
hall. Her voice was heard: &ldquo;Mamma?&rdquo; Then
there was the silence of an unheard consultation. The
young man moved a step or two into the parlor and
returned toward the door as a light double foot-fall
approached again down the hall and the girl appeared
once more, somewhat preceded by a small, tired-looking,
pretty woman some thirty-five years of age,
of slow, self-contained movement and clear, meditative
eyes.</p>

<p>But the guest, too, had been re-enforced. A man
had come silently from the fireside, taken his hand,
and now, near the doorway, was softly shaking it and
smiling. Surprise, pleasure, and reverential regard
were mingled in the young man&rsquo;s face, and his open
mouth was gasping&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mister Tarbox!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Claude St. Pierre, after six years, I&rsquo;m glad to see
you.&mdash;Madame, take good care of Claude.&mdash;No fear
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
but she will, my boy; if anybody in Louisiana knows
how to take care of a traveller, it&rsquo;s Madame Beausoleil.&rdquo;
He smiled for all. The daughter&rsquo;s large black
eyes danced, but the mother asked Claude, with unmoved
countenance and soft tone:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are Claude St. Pierre?&mdash;from Gran&rsquo;
Point&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yass.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dass lately since you left yondah?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;About two month&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bonaventure Deschamps&mdash;he was well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yass.&rdquo; Claude&rsquo;s eyes were full of a glad surprise,
and asked a question that his lips did not dare
to venture upon. Madame Beausoleil read it, and she
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We was raise&rsquo; together, Bonaventure and me.&rdquo;
She waved her hand toward her daughter. &ldquo;He teach
her to read. Seet down to the fire; we make you some
sopper.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>MARGUERITE.</h3>


<p>Out in the kitchen, while the coffee was dripping
and the ham and eggs frying, the mother was very
silent, and the daughter said little, but followed her now
and then with furtive liftings of her young black eyes.
Marguerite remembered Bonaventure Deschamps well
and lovingly. For years she had seen the letters that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
at long intervals came from him at Grande Pointe to
her mother here. In almost every one of them she
had read high praises of Claude. He had grown, thus,
to be the hero of her imagination. She had wondered
if it could ever happen that he would come within her
sight, and if so, when, where, how. And now, here
at a time of all times when it would have seemed least
possible, he had, as it were, rained down.</p>

<p>She wondered to-night, with more definiteness of
thought than ever before, what were the deep feelings
which her reticent little mother&mdash;Marguerite was an
inch the taller&mdash;kept hid in that dear breast. Rarely
had emotion moved it. She remembered its terrible
heavings at the time of her father&rsquo;s death, and the
later silent downpour of tears when her only sister and
brother were taken in one day. Since then, those
eyes had rarely been wet; yet more than once or twice
she had seen tears in them when they were reading a
letter from Grande Pointe. Had her mother ever had
something more than a sister&rsquo;s love for Bonaventure?
Had Bonaventure loved her? And when? Before her
marriage, or after her widowhood?</p>

<p>The only answer that came to her as she now stood,
knife in hand, by the griddle, was a roar of laughter
that found its way through the hall, the dining-room,
and two closed doors, from the men about the waiting-room
fireside. That was the third time she had heard
it. What could have put them so soon into such gay
mood? Could it be Claude? Somehow she hoped it
was not. Her mother reminded her that the batter-cakes
would burn. She quickly turned them. The
laugh came again.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
When by and by she went to bid Claude to his repast,
the laughter, as she reached the door of the
waiting-room, burst upon her as the storm would have
done had she opened the front door. It came from all
but Claude and Mr. Tarbox. Claude sat with a knee
in his hands, smiling. The semicircle had widened out
from the fire, and in the midst Mr. Tarbox stood telling
a story, of which Grande Pointe was the scene, Bonaventure
Deschamps the hero, a school-examination the
circumstance, and he, G. W., the accidental arbiter of
destinies that hung upon its results. The big-waisted
man had retired for the night, and half an eye could
see that the story-teller had captivated the whole remaining
audience. He was just at the end as Marguerite
re-appeared at the door. The laugh suddenly
ceased, and then all rose; it was high bedtime.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And did they get married?&rdquo; asked one. Three
or four gathered close to hear the answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who? Sidonie and Bonnyventure? Yes. I didn&rsquo;t
stay to see. I went away into Mississippi, Tennessee,
and Alabama, and just only a few weeks ago took a
notion to try this Attakapas and Opelousas region.
But that&rsquo;s what Claude tells me to-night&mdash;married
more than five years ago.&mdash;Claude, your supper wants
you. Want me to go out and sit with you? Oh, no
trouble! not the slightest! It will make me feel as if
I was nearer to Bonnyventure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so the group about Claude&rsquo;s late supper numbered
four. And because each had known Bonaventure,
though each in a very different way from any
other, they were four friends when Claude had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
demolished the ham and eggs, the strong black coffee, and
the griddle-cakes and sirop-de-batterie.</p>

<p>At the top of the hall stairway, as Mr. Tarbox was
on his way to bed, one of the dispersed fireside circle
stopped him, saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s an awful good story!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t try a poor one on you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&mdash;but really, now, in good earnest, it is good.
It&rsquo;s good in more ways than one. Now, you know,
that man, hid away there in the swamp at Grande
Pointe, he little thinks that six or eight men away off
here in Vermilionville are going to bed to-night better
men&mdash;that&rsquo;s it, sir&mdash;yes, sir, that&rsquo;s it&mdash;yes, sir!&mdash;better
men&mdash;just for having heard of him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Tarbox smiled with affectionate approval, and
began to move away; but the other put out a hand&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, look here; I&rsquo;m going away on that two
o&rsquo;clock train to-night. I want that book of yours.
And I don&rsquo;t want to subscribe and wait. I want the
book now. That&rsquo;s my way. I&rsquo;m just that kind of a
man; I&rsquo;m the nowest man you ever met up with.
That book&rsquo;s just the kind of thing for a man like me
who ain&rsquo;t got no time to go exhaustively delving and
investigating and researching into things, and yet has
got to keep as sharp as a brier.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Tarbox, on looking into his baggage, found he
could oblige this person. Before night fell again he
had done virtually the same thing, one by one, for all
the rest. By that time they were all gone; but Mr.
Tarbox made Vermilionville his base of operations for
several days.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
Claude also tarried. For reasons presently to appear,
the &ldquo;ladies parlor,&rdquo; a small room behind the
waiting-room, with just one door, which let into the
hall at the hall&rsquo;s inner end, was given up to his use;
and of evenings not only Mr. Tarbox, but Marguerite
and her mother as well, met with him, gathering familiarly
about a lamp that other male lodgers were not
invited to hover around.</p>

<p>The group was not idle. Mr. Tarbox held big hanks
of blue and yellow yarn, which Zos&eacute;phine wound off
into balls. A square table quite filled the centre of
the room. There was a confusion of objects on it,
and now on one side and now on another Claude leaned
over it and slowly toiled, from morning until evening
alone, and in the evening with these three about him;
Marguerite, with her sewing dropped upon the floor,
watching his work with an interest almost wholly
silent, only making now and then a murmured comment,
her eyes passing at intervals from his pre-occupied
eyes to his hands, and her hand now and then
guessing and supplying his want as he looked for one
thing or another that had got out of sight. What was
he doing?</p>

<p>As to Marguerite, more than he was aware of,
Zos&eacute;phine Beausoleil saw, and was already casting
about somewhat anxiously in her mind to think what,
if any thing, ought to be done about it. She saw her
child&rsquo;s sewing lie forgotten on the floor, and the eyes
that should have been following the needle, fixed often
on the absorbed, unconscious, boyish-manly face so
near by. She saw them scanning the bent brows, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
smooth bronzed cheek, the purposeful mouth, and
the unusual length of dark eyelashes that gave its
charm to the whole face; and she saw them quickly
withdrawn whenever the face with those lashes was
lifted and an unsuspecting smile of young companionship
broke slowly about the relaxing lips and the soft,
deep-curtained eyes. No; Claude little knew what he
was doing. Neither did Marguerite. But, aside from
her, what was his occupation? I will explain.</p>

<p>About five weeks earlier than this, a passenger on
an eastward-bound train of Morgan&rsquo;s Louisiana and
Texas Railway stood at the rear door of the last coach,
eying critically the track as it glided swiftly from under
the train and shrank perpetually into the west. The
coach was nearly empty. No one was near him save
the brakeman, and by and by he took his attention
from the track and let it rest on this person. There
he found a singular attraction. Had he seen that face
before, or why did it provoke vague reminiscences of
great cypresses overhead, and deep-shaded leafy distances
with bayous winding out of sight through them,
and cane-brakes impenetrable to the eye, and axe-strokes&mdash;heard
but unseen&mdash;slashing through them
only a few feet away? Suddenly he knew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it your father,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;who was my
guide up Bayou des Acadiens and Blind River the time
I made the survey in that big swamp north of Grande
Pointe? Isn&rsquo;t your name Claude St. Pierre?&rdquo; And
presently they were acquainted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know I took a great fancy to your father.
And you&rsquo;ve been clear through the arithmetic twice?
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
Why, see here; you&rsquo;re just the sort of man I&mdash;Look
here; don&rsquo;t you want to learn to be a surveyor?&rdquo;
The questioner saw that same ambition which
had pleased him so in the father, leap for joy in the
son&rsquo;s eyes.</p>

<p>An agreement was quickly reached. Then the surveyor
wandered into another coach, and nothing more
passed between them that day save one matter, which,
though trivial, has its place. When the surveyor returned
to the rear train, Claude was in a corner seat
gazing pensively through the window and out across
the wide, backward-flying, purpling green cane-fields
of St. Mary, to where on the far left the live-oaks
of Bayou Teche seemed hoveringly to follow on the
flank of their whooping and swaggering railway-train.
Claude turned and met the stranger&rsquo;s regard with a
faint smile. His new friend spoke first.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Matters may turn out so that we can have your
father&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>Claude&rsquo;s eyes answered with a glad flash. &ldquo;Dass
what I was t&rsquo;inkin&rsquo;!&rdquo; he said, with a soft glow that
staid even when he fell again into revery.</p>

<p>But when the engineer&mdash;for it seems that he was
an engineer, chief of a party engaged in redeeming
some extensive waste swamp and marsh lands&mdash;when
the chief engineer, on the third day afterward, drew
near the place where he suddenly recollected Claude
would be waiting to enter his service, and recalled this
part of their previous interview, he said to himself,
&ldquo;No, it would be good for the father, but not best for
the son,&rdquo; and fell to thinking how often parents are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
called upon to wrench their affections down into cruel
bounds to make the foundations of their children&rsquo;s
prosperity.</p>

<p>Claude widened to his new experience with the
rapidity of something hatched out of a shell. Moreover,
accident was in his favor; the party was short-handed
in its upper ranks, and Claude found himself
by this stress taken into larger and larger tasks as fast
as he could, though ever so crudely, qualify for them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t at all the best thing for you,&rdquo; said one of
the surveyors, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll lend you some books that will
teach you the why as well as the how.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the use of these books by lantern-light certain
skill with the pen showed itself; and when at length
one day a despatch reached camp from the absent
&ldquo;chief&rdquo; stating that in two or three days certain matters
would take him to Vermilionville, and ordering
that some one be sent at once with all necessary field
notes and appliances, and give his undivided time to
the making of certain urgently needed maps, and the
only real draughtsman of the party was ill with swamp-fever,
Claude was sent.</p>

<p>On his last half-day&rsquo;s journey toward the place, he
had fallen in with an old gentleman whom others
called &ldquo;Governor,&rdquo; a tall, trim figure, bent but little
under fourscore years, with cheerful voice and ready
speech, and eyes hidden behind dark glasses and
flickering in their deep sockets.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go to Madame Beausoleil&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he advised Claude.
&ldquo;That is the place for you. Excellent person; I&rsquo;ve
known her from childhood; a woman worthy a higher
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
station.&rdquo; And so, all by accident, chance upon
chance, here was Claude making maps; and this delightful
work, he thought, was really all he was doing,
in Zos&eacute;phine&rsquo;s little inner parlor.</p>

<p>By and by it was done. The engineer had not yet
arrived. The storm had delayed work in one place
and undone work in another, and he was detained
beyond expectation. But a letter said he would come
in a day or two more, and some maps of earlier surveys,
drawn by skilled workmen in great New Orleans,
arrived; seeing which, Claude blushed for his own and
fell to work to make them over.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If at first you not succeed,&rdquo; said Claude,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Try&mdash;try aga-a-ain,&rdquo; responded Marguerite;
&ldquo;Bonaventure learn me that poetry; and you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yass,&rdquo; said Claude. He stood looking down at
his work and not seeing it. What he saw was Grande
Pointe in the sunset hour of a spring day six years
gone, the wet, spongy margin of a tiny bayou under
his feet, the great swamp at his back, the leafy undergrowth
all around; his canoe and paddle waiting for
him, and Bonaventure repeating to him&mdash;swamp urchin
of fourteen&mdash;the costliest words of kindness&mdash;to
both of them the costliest&mdash;that he had ever heard,
ending with these two that Marguerite had spoken.
As he resumed his work, he said, without lifting his
eyes:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seem&rsquo; to me &rsquo;f I could make myself like any man
in dat whole worl&rsquo;, I radder make myself like Bonaventure.
And you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was so slow to answer that he looked at her.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
Even then she merely kept on sweeping her fingers
slowly and idly back and forth on the table, and, glancing
down upon them, said without enthusiasm:
&ldquo;Yass.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yet they both loved Bonaventure, each according to
knowledge of him. Nor did their common likings stop
with him. The things he had taught Claude to love
and seek suddenly became the admiration of Marguerite.
Aspirations&mdash;aspirations!&mdash;began to stir and
hum in her young heart, and to pour forth like waking
bees in the warm presence of spring. Claude was a
new interpretation of life to her; as one caught abed
by the first sunrise at sea, her whole spirit leaped,
with unmeasured self-reproach, into fresh garments and
to a new and beautiful stature, and looked out upon a
wider heaven and earth than ever it had seen or desired
to see before. All at once the life was more than
meat and the body than raiment. Presently she sprang
to action. In the convent school, whose white belfry
you could see from the end of Madame Beausoleil&rsquo;s
balcony, whither Zos&eacute;phine had sent her after teaching
her all she herself knew, it had been &ldquo;the mind for
knowledge;&rdquo; now it was &ldquo;knowledge for the mind.&rdquo;
Mental training and enrichment had a value now,
never before dreamed of. The old school-books were
got down, recalled from banishment. Nothing ever
had been hard to learn, and now she found that all she
seemed to have forgotten merely required, like the
books, a little beating clear of dust.</p>

<p>And Claude was there to help. &ldquo;If C&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;C!&mdash;--&ldquo;having
a start of one hundred miles, travels&rdquo;&mdash;so
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
and so, and so and so,&mdash;&ldquo;how fast must I travel
in order to&rdquo;&mdash;etc. She cannot work the problem for
thinking of what it symbolizes. As C himself takes
the slate, her dark eyes, lifted an instant to his, are
large with painful meaning, for she sees at a glance she
must travel&mdash;if the arithmetical is the true answer&mdash;more
than the whole distance now between them. But
Claude says there is an easy way. She draws her
chair nearer and nearer to his; he bows over the problem,
and she cannot follow his pencil without bending
her head very close to his&mdash;closer&mdash;closer&mdash;until
fluffy bits of her black hair touch the thick locks on his
temples. Look to your child, Zos&eacute;phine Beausoleil,
look to her! Ah! she can look; but what can she
do?</p>

<p>She saw the whole matter; saw more than merely
an unripe girl smitten with the bright smile, goodly
frame, and bewitching eyes of a promising young
rustic; saw her heart ennobled, her nature enlarged,
and all the best motives of life suddenly illuminated
by the presence of one to be mated with whom promised
the key-note of all harmonies; promised heart-fellowship
in the ever-hoping effort to lift poor daily
existence higher and higher out of the dust and into
the light. What could she say? If great spirits in
men or maidens went always or only with high fortune,
a mere Acadian lass, a tavern maiden, were safe
enough, come one fate or another. If Marguerite
were like many a girl in high ranks and low, to whom
any husband were a husband, any snug roof a home,
and any living life&mdash;But what may a maiden do, or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
a mother bid her do, when she looks upon the youth so
shaped without and within to her young soul&rsquo;s belief
in its wants, that all other men are but beasts of the
field and creeping things, and he alone Adam? To
whom could the widow turn? Father, mother?&mdash;Gone
to their rest. The cur&eacute; who had stood over her in
baptism, marriage, and bereavement?&mdash;Called long
ago to higher dignities and wider usefulness in distant
fields. Oh for the presence and counsel of Bonaventure!
It is true, here was Mr. Tarbox, so kind, and
so replete with information; so shrewd and so ready to
advise. She spurned the thought of leaning on him;
and yet the oft-spurned thought as often returned.
Already his generous interest had explored her pecuniary
affairs, and his suggestions, too good to be ignored,
had moulded them into better shape, and enlarged
their net results. And he could tell how many eight-ounce
tacks make a pound, and what electricity is, and
could cure a wart in ten minutes, and recite &ldquo;Oh! why
should the spirit of mortal be proud?&rdquo; And this
evening, the seventh since the storm, when for one
weak moment she had allowed the conversation to
drift toward wedlock, he had stated a woman&rsquo;s chances
of marrying between the ages of fifteen and twenty,
to wit, 14&frac12; per cent; and between thirty and thirty-five,
15&frac12;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hah!&rdquo; exclaimed Zos&eacute;phine, her eyes flashing as
they had not done in many a day, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis not dat way!&mdash;not
in Opelousas!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Arithmetically speaking!&rdquo; the statistician quickly
explained. He ventured to lay a forefinger on the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
back of her hand, but one glance of her eye removed
it. &ldquo;You see, that&rsquo;s merely arithmetically considered.
Now, of course, looking at it geographically&mdash;why, of
course! And&mdash;why, as to that, there are ladies&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>Madame Beausoleil rose, left Mr. Tarbox holding
the yarn, and went down the hall, whose outer door
had opened and shut. A moment later she entered
the room again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Claude!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marguerite&rsquo;s heart sank. Her guess was right: the
chief engineer had come. And early in the morning
Claude was gone.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<h3><a name="PART_III_CHAP_V" id="PART_III_CHAP_V"></a>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<h3>FATHER AND SON.</h3>


<p>Such strange things storms do,&mdash;here purifying the
air, yonder treading down rich harvests, now replenishing
the streams, and now strewing shores with wrecks;
here a blessing, there a calamity. See what this one
had done for Marguerite! Well, what? She could
not lament; she dared not rejoice. Oh! if she were
Claude and Claude were she, how quickly&mdash;</p>

<p>She wondered how many miles a day she could learn
to walk if she should start out into the world on foot
to find somebody, as she had heard that Bonaventure
had once done to find her mother&rsquo;s lover. There are no
Bonaventures now, she thinks, in these decayed times.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
&ldquo;Mamma,&rdquo;&mdash;her speech was French,&mdash;&ldquo;why do
we never see Bonaventure? How far is it to Grande
Pointe?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! my child, a hundred miles; even more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And to my uncle Rosamond&rsquo;s,&mdash;Rosamond Robichaux,
on Bayou Terrebonne?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fully as far, and almost the same journey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was but one thing to be done,&mdash;crush Claude
out of her heart.</p>

<p>The storm had left no wounds on Grande Pointe.
Every roof was safe, even the old tobacco-shed where
Bonaventure had kept school before the schoolhouse
was built. The sheltering curtains of deep forest had
broken the onset of the wind, and the little cotton,
corn, and tobacco fields, already harvested, were
merely made a little more tattered and brown. The
November air was pure, sunny, and mild, and thrilled
every now and then with the note of some lingering
bird. A green and bosky confusion still hid house
from house and masked from itself the all but motionless
human life of the sleepy woods village. Only
an adventitious China-tree here and there had been
stripped of its golden foliage, and kept but its ripened
berries with the red birds darting and fluttering around
them like so many hiccoughing Comanches about a
dramseller&rsquo;s tent. And here, if one must tell a thing
so painful, our old friend the mocking-bird, neglecting
his faithful wife and letting his home go to decay, kept
dropping in, all hours of the day, tasting the berries&rsquo;
rank pulp, stimulating, stimulating, drowning care, you
know,&mdash;&ldquo;Lost so many children, and the rest gone
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
off in ungrateful forgetfulness of their old hard-working
father; yes;&rdquo; and ready to sing or fight, just as
any other creature happened not to wish; and going
home in the evening scolding and swaggering, and
getting to bed barely able to hang on to the roost. It
would have been bad enough, even for a man; but for
a bird&mdash;and a mocking-bird!</p>

<p>But the storm wrought a great change in one small
house not in Grande Pointe, yet of it. Until the storm,
ever since the day St. Pierre had returned from the
little railway-station where Claude had taken the cars,
he had seemed as patiently resigned to the new loneliness
of Bayou des Acadiens as his thatched hut, which
day by day sat so silent between the edges of the dark
forest and the darker stream, looking out beyond the
farther bank, and far over the green waste of rushes
with its swarms of blackbirds sweeping capriciously
now this way and now that, and the phantom cloud-shadows
passing slowly across from one far line of
cypress wood to another. But since that night when
the hut&rsquo;s solitary occupant could not sleep for the
winds and for thought of Claude, there was a great
difference inside. And this did not diminish; it grew.
It is hard for a man to be both father and mother,
and at the same time be childless. The bonds of this
condition began slowly to tighten around St. Pierre&rsquo;s
heart and then to cut into it. And so, the same day
on which Claude in Vermilionville left the Beausoleils&rsquo;
tavern, the cabin on Bayou des Acadiens, ever in his
mind&rsquo;s eye, was empty, and in Grande Pointe his
father stood on the one low step at the closed door of
Bonaventure&rsquo;s little frame schoolhouse.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
He had been there a full minute and had not knocked.
Every movement, to-day, came only after an inward
struggle. Many associations crowded his mind on this
doorstep. Six years before, almost on this spot, a
mere brier-patch then, he and Maximian Roussel had
risen from the grassy earth and given the first two
welcoming hand-grasps to the schoolmaster. And now,
as one result, Claude, who did not know his letters
then, was rising&mdash;nay, had risen&mdash;to greatness!
Claude, whom once he would have been glad to
make a good fisherman and swamper, or at the utmost
a sugar-boiler, was now a greater, in rank at
least, than the very schoolmaster. Truly &ldquo;knowledge
is power&rdquo;&mdash;alas! yes; for it had stolen away
that same Claude. The College Point priest&rsquo;s warning
had come true: it was &ldquo;good-by to Grande Pointe!&rdquo;&mdash;Nay,
nay, it must not be! Is that the kind of
power education is? Power to tear children from
their parents? Power to expose their young heads to
midnight storms? Power to make them eager to go,
and willing to stay away, from their paternal homes?
Then indeed the priest had said only too truly, that
these public schools teach every thing except morals
and religion! From the depth of St. Pierre&rsquo;s heart
there quickly came a denial of the charge; and on the
moment, like a chanted response, there fell upon his
listening ear a monotonous intonation from within the
door. A reading-class had begun its exercise. He
knew the words by heart, so often had Claude and
he read them together. He followed the last stanza
silently with his own lips.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Remember, child, remember<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That you love, with all your might,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The God who watches o&rsquo;er us<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And gives us each delight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who guards us ever in the day,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And saves as in the night.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Tears filled the swamper&rsquo;s eyes. He moved as if to
leave the place. But again he paused, with one foot
half lowered to the ground. His jaws set, a frown
came between his eyes; he drew back the foot, turned
again to the door, and gave a loud, peremptory knock.</p>

<p>Bonaventure came to the door. Anxiety quickly
overspread his face as he saw the gloom on St. Pierre&rsquo;s.
He stood on the outer edge of the sill, and drew the
door after him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I got good news,&rdquo; said St. Pierre, with no
softening of countenance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good news?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yass.&mdash;I goin&rsquo; make Claude come home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bonaventure could only look at him in amazement.
St. Pierre looked away and continued:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;S no use. Can&rsquo;t stand it no longer.&rdquo; He turned
suddenly upon the schoolmaster. &ldquo;Why you di&rsquo;n&rsquo;
tell me ed&rsquo;cation goin&rsquo; teck my boy &rsquo;way from me?&rdquo;
In Bonaventure a look of distressful self-justification
quickly changed to one of anxious compassion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; he said. He went back into the schoolroom,
leaving St. Pierre in the open door, and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear chil&rsquo;run, I perceive generally the aspects of
fatigue. You have been good scholars. I pronounce
a half-hollyday till to-morrow morning. Come, each
and every one, with lessons complete.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
The children dispersed peaceably, jostling one another
to shake the schoolmaster&rsquo;s hand as they passed
him. When they were gone he put on his coarse straw
hat, and the two men walked slowly, conversing as
they went, down the green road that years before had
first brought the educator to Grande Pointe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear friend,&rdquo; said the schoolmaster, &ldquo;shall education
be to blame for this separation? Is not also
non-education responsible? Is it not by the non-education
of Grande Pointe that there is nothing fit
here for Claude&rsquo;s staying?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You stay!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I? I stay? Ah! sir, I stay, yes! Because like
Claude, leaving my home and seeking by wandering
to find the true place of my utility, a voice spake that
I come at Grande Pointe. Behole me! as far from
my childhood home as Claude from his. Friend,&mdash;ah!
friend, what shall I,&mdash;shall Claude,&mdash;shall any
man do with education! Keep it? Like a miser his
gol&rsquo;? What shall the ship do when she is load&rsquo;? Dear
friend,&rdquo;&mdash;they halted where another road started
away through the underbrush at an abrupt angle on
their right,&mdash;&ldquo;where leads this narrow road? To
Belle Alliance plantation only, or not also to the whole
worl&rsquo;? So is education! That road here once fetch
me at Grande Pointe; the same road fetch Claude
away. Education came whispering, &lsquo;Claude St. Pierre,
come! I have constitute&rsquo; you citizen of the worl&rsquo;.
Come, come, forgetting self!&rsquo; Oh, dear friend, education
is not for self alone! Nay, even self is not for
self!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
&ldquo;Well, den,&rdquo;&mdash;the deep-voiced woodman stood
with one boot on a low stump, fiercely trimming a
branch that he had struck from the parent stem with
one blow of his big, keen clasp-knife,&mdash;&ldquo;self not
for self,&mdash;for what he gone off and lef&rsquo; me in de
swamp?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, sir!&rdquo; replied Bonaventure, &ldquo;what do I unceasingly
tell those dear school-chil&rsquo;run? &lsquo;May we
not make the most of self, yet not for self?&rsquo;&rdquo; He
laid his hand upon St. Pierre&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;And who
sent Claude hence if not his unselfish father?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was big fool,&rdquo; said St. Pierre, whittling on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, wise! Discovering the great rule of civilize-ation.
Every man not for self, but for every other!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The swamper disclaimed the generous imputation
with a shake of the head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Naw, I dunno nut&rsquo;n&rsquo; &rsquo;bout dat. I look out for
me and my boy, me.&mdash;And beside,&rdquo;&mdash;he abruptly
threw away the staff he had trimmed, shut his knife
with a snap, and thrust it into his pocket,&mdash;&ldquo;I dawn&rsquo;t
see ed&rsquo;cation make no diff&rsquo;ence. You say ed&rsquo;cation&mdash;priest
say religion&mdash;me, I dawn&rsquo;t see neider one make
no diff&rsquo;ence. I see every man look out for hisself and
his li&rsquo;l&rsquo; crowd. Not you, but&rdquo;&mdash;He waved his
hand bitterly toward the world at large.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, sir!&rdquo; cried Bonaventure, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis not something
what you can see all the time, like the horns on a cow!
And yet, sir,&mdash;and yet!&rdquo;&mdash;he lifted himself upon
tiptoe and ran his fingers through his thin hair&mdash;&ldquo;the
education that make&rsquo; no difference is but a dead body!
and the religion that make&rsquo; no difference is a ghost!
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
Behole! behole two thing&rsquo; in the worl&rsquo;, where all is
giving and getting, two thing&rsquo;, con<em>tra</em>ry, yet resem&rsquo;ling!
&rsquo;Tis the left han&rsquo;&mdash;alas, alas!&mdash;giving only
to get; and the right, blessed of God, getting only to
give! How much resem&rsquo;ling, yet how con<em>tra</em>ry! The
one&mdash;han&rsquo; of all strife; the other&mdash;of all peace.
And oh! dear friend, there are those who call the one
civilize-ation, and the other religion. Civilize-ation?
Religion? They are one! They are body and soul!
I care not what religion the priest teach you; in God&rsquo;s
religion is comprise&rsquo; the total <i>m&eacute;canique</i> of civilize-ation.
We are all in it; you, me, Claude, Sidonie;
all in it! Each and every at his task, however high,
however low, working not to get, but to give, and not
to give only to his own li&rsquo;l&rsquo; crowd, but to all, to all!&rdquo;
The speaker ceased, for his hearer was nodding his
head with sceptical impatience.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yass,&rdquo; said the woodman, &ldquo;yass; but look, Bonaventure.
Di&rsquo;n&rsquo; you said one time, &lsquo;Knowledge is
power&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, truly; and it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what use knowledge be power if goin&rsquo; give
ev&rsquo;t&rsquo;in&rsquo; away?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bonaventure drew back a step or two, suddenly
jerked his hat from his head, and came forward again
with arms stretched wide and the hat dangling from
his hand. &ldquo;Because&mdash;because God will not let it
sta-a-ay given away! &lsquo;Give&mdash;it shall be give&rsquo; to
you.&rsquo; Every thing given out into God&rsquo;s worl&rsquo; come
back to us roun&rsquo; God&rsquo;s worl&rsquo;! Resem&rsquo;ling the stirring
of water in a bucket.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
But St. Pierre frowned. &ldquo;Yass,&mdash;wat&rsquo; in bucket,&mdash;yass.
Den no man dawn&rsquo;t keep nut&rsquo;n&rsquo;. Dawn&rsquo;t
own nut&rsquo;n&rsquo; he got.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! sir, there is a better owning than to <em>own</em>.
&rsquo;Tis giving, dear friend; &rsquo;tis giving. To get? To
have? That is not to own. The giver, not the getter;
the giver! he is the true owner. Live thou not to get,
but to give.&rdquo; Bonaventure&rsquo;s voice trembled; his eyes
were full of tears.</p>

<p>The swamper stood up with his own eyes full, but
his voice was firm. &ldquo;Bonaventure, I don&rsquo;t got much.
I got dat li&rsquo;l&rsquo; shanty on Bayou des Acadiens, and
li&rsquo;l&rsquo; plunder inside&mdash;few kittle&rsquo;, and pan&rsquo;,&mdash;cast-net,
fish-line&rsquo;, two, t&rsquo;ree gun&rsquo;, and&mdash;my wife&rsquo; grave,
yond&rsquo; in graveyard. But I got Claude,&mdash;my boy, my
son. You t&rsquo;ink God want me give my son to whole
worl&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The schoolmaster took the woodsman&rsquo;s brown wrist
tenderly into both his hands, and said, scarce above a
whisper, &ldquo;He gave His, first. He started it. Who
can refuse, He starting it? And thou wilt not refuse.&rdquo;
The voice rose&mdash;&ldquo;I see, I see the victory! Well art
thou nominated &lsquo;St. Pierre!&rsquo; for on that rock of
giving&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Naw, sir! Stop!&rdquo; The swamper dashed the
moisture from his eyes and summoned a look of stubborn
resolve. &ldquo;Mo&rsquo; better you call me St. Pierre
because I&rsquo;m a fisherman what cuss when I git mad.
Look! You dawn&rsquo;t want me git Claude back in Gran&rsquo;
Point&rsquo;. You want me to give, give. Well, all right!
I goin&rsquo; <em>quit</em> Gran&rsquo; Point&rsquo; and give myself, me, to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
Claude. I kin read, I kin write, I t&rsquo;ink kin do better
&rsquo;long wid Claude dan livin&rsquo; all &rsquo;lone wid snake&rsquo; and
alligator. I t&rsquo;ink dass mo&rsquo; better for everybody; and
anyhow, I dawn&rsquo;t care; I dawn&rsquo;t give my son to nobody;
I give myself to Claude.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bonaventure and his friend gazed into each other&rsquo;s
wet eyes for a moment. Then the schoolmaster turned,
lifted his eyes and one arm toward the west, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, Claude! thou receivest the noblest gift in
Gran&rsquo; Point&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>

<h3>CONVERGING LINES.</h3>


<p>On the prairies of Vermilion and Lafayette, winter
is virtually over by the first week in February. From
sky to sky, each tree and field, each plain and plantation
grove, are putting on the greenery of a Northern
May. Even on C&ocirc;te Gel&eacute;e the housewife has persuaded
<i>le vieux</i> to lay aside his gun, and the early
potatoes are already planted. If the moon be at the
full, much ground is ready for the sower; and those
ploughmen and pony teams and men working along
behind them with big, clumsy hoes, over in yonder
field, are planting corn. Those silent, tremulous
strands of black that in the morning sky come gliding,
high overhead, from the direction of the great
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
sea-marshes and fade into the northern blue, are flocks
that have escaped the murderous gun of the pot-hunter.
Spring and Summer are driving these before them as
the younger and older sister, almost abreast, come
laughing, and striving to outrun each other across the
Mexican Gulf.</p>

<p>Those two travellers on horseback, so dwarfed by
distance, whom you see approaching out of the north-west,
you shall presently find have made, in their dress,
no provision against cold. At Carancro, some miles
away to the north-east, there is a thermometer; and
somewhere in Vermilionville, a like distance to the
south-east, there might possibly be found a barometer;
but there is no need of either to tell that the air to-day
is threescore and ten and will be more before it is less.
Before the riders draw near you have noticed that only
one is a man and the other a woman. And now you
may see that he is sleek and alert, blonde and bland,
and the savage within us wants to knock off his silk
hat. All the more so for that she is singularly pretty
to be met in his sole care. The years count on her
brows, it is true, but the way in which they tell of
matronhood&mdash;and somehow of widowhood too&mdash;is
a very fair and gentle way. Her dress is plain, but
its lines have a grace that is also dignity; and the lines
of her face&mdash;lines is too hard a word for them&mdash;are
not those of time, but of will and of care, that have
chastened and refined one another. She speaks only
now and then. Her companion&rsquo;s speech fills the wide
intervals.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yesterday morning,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;as I came along
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
here a little after sunrise, there was a thin fog lying
only two or three feet deep, close to the level ground
as far as you could see, hiding the whole prairie, and
making it look for all the world like a beautiful lake,
with every here and there a green grove standing out
of it like a real little island.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She replies that she used to see it so in her younger
days. The Acadian accent is in her words. She lifts
her black eyes, looks toward Carancro, and is silent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re thinking of the changes,&rdquo; says her escort.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yass; <em>&rsquo;tis</em> so. Dey got twenty time&rsquo; many field&rsquo;
like had befo&rsquo;. Peop&rsquo; don&rsquo;t raise cattl&rsquo; no more;
raise crop&rsquo;. Dey say even dat land changin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How changing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dunno. I dunno if <em>&rsquo;tis</em> so. Dey say prairie
risin&rsquo; mo&rsquo; higher every year. I dunno if <em>&rsquo;tis</em> so. I t&rsquo;ink
dat land don&rsquo;t change much; but de peop&rsquo;, yass.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Still, the changes are mostly good changes,&rdquo; responds
the male rider. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t the prairie, but the
people that are rising. They&rsquo;ve got the schoolhouse,
and the English language, and a free paid labor system,
and the railroads, and painted wagons, and Cincinnati
furniture, and sewing-machines, and melodeons,
and Horsford&rsquo;s Acid Phosphate; and they&rsquo;ve caught
the spirit of progress!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yass, <em>&rsquo;tis</em> so. Dawn&rsquo;t see nobody seem satisfied&mdash;since
de army&mdash;since de railroad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s right enough; they oughtn&rsquo;t to be
satisfied. You&rsquo;re not satisfied, are you? And yet
you&rsquo;ve never done so well before as you have this
season. I wish I could say the same for the &lsquo;Album
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
of Universal Information;&rsquo; but I can&rsquo;t. I tell you
that, Madame Beausoleil; I wouldn&rsquo;t tell anybody
else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zos&eacute;phine responds with a dignified bow. She has
years ago noticed in herself, that, though she has
strength of will, she lacks clearness and promptness
of decision. She is at a loss, now, to know what to
do with Mr. Tarbox. Here he is for the seventh time.
But there is always a plausible explanation of his presence,
and a person of more tactful propriety, it seems
to her, never put his name upon her tavern register or
himself into her company. She sees nothing shallow
or specious in his dazzling attainments; they rekindle
the old ambitions in her that Bonaventure lighted; and
although Mr. Tarbox&rsquo;s modest loveliness is not visible,
yet a certain fundamental rectitude, discernible behind
all his nebulous gaudiness, confirms her liking. Then,
too, he has earned her gratitude. She has inherited
not only her father&rsquo;s small fortune, but his thrift as
well. She can see the sagacity of Mr. Tarbox&rsquo;s advice
in pecuniary matters, and once and once again, when
he has told her quietly of some little operation into
which he and the ex-governor&mdash;who &ldquo;thinks the
world of me,&rdquo; he says&mdash;were going to dip, and she
has accepted his invitation to venture in also, to the
extent of a single thousand dollars, the money has
come back handsomely increased. Even now, the sale
of all her prairie lands to her former kinsmen-in-law,
which brought her out here yesterday and lets her
return this morning, is made upon his suggestion, and
is so advantageous that somehow, she doesn&rsquo;t know
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
why, she almost fears it isn&rsquo;t fair to the other side.
The fact is, the country is passing from the pastoral
to the agricultural life, the prairies are being turned
into countless farms, and the people are getting wealth.
So explains Mr. Tarbox, whose happening to come
along this morning bound in her direction is pure
accident&mdash;pure accident.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, the &lsquo;A. of U. I.&rsquo; hasn&rsquo;t done its best,&rdquo; he
says again. &ldquo;For one thing, I&rsquo;ve had other fish to fry.
You know that.&rdquo; He ventures a glance at her eyes,
but they ignore it, and he adds, &ldquo;I mean other financial
matters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>&rsquo;Tis</em> so,&rdquo; says Zos&eacute;phine; and Mr. Tarbox hopes
the reason for this faint repulse is only the nearness
of this farmhouse peeping at them through its pink
veil of blossoming peach-trees, as they leisurely trot
by.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he says; &ldquo;and, besides, &lsquo;Universal Information&rsquo;
isn&rsquo;t what this people want. The book&rsquo;s
too catholic for them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too Cat&rsquo;oleek!&rdquo; Zos&eacute;phine raises her pretty
eyebrows in grave astonishment&mdash;&ldquo;&rsquo;Cadian&rsquo; is all
Cat&rsquo;oleek.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, ecclesiastically speaking, I know. That
wasn&rsquo;t my meaning. Your smaller meaning puts my
larger one out of sight; yes, just as this Cherokee
hedge puts out of sight the miles of prairie fields, and
even that house we just passed. No, the &lsquo;A. of U. I.,&rsquo;&mdash;I
love to call it that; can you guess why?&rdquo; There
is a venturesome twinkle in his smile, and even a playful
permission in her own as she shakes her head.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll tell you; it&rsquo;s because it brings U and I
so near together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hah!&rdquo; exclaims Madame Beausoleil, warningly,
yet with sunshine and cloud on her brow at once.
She likes her companion&rsquo;s wit, always so deep, and
yet always so delicately pointed! His hearty laugh
just now disturbs her somewhat, but they are out on
the wide plain again, without a spot in all the sweep
of her glance where an eye or an ear may ambush
them or their walking horses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; insists her fellow-traveller; &ldquo;I say again,
as I said before, the &lsquo;A. of U. I.&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;he pauses at the
initials, and Zos&eacute;phine&rsquo;s faint smile gives him ecstasy&mdash;&ldquo;hasn&rsquo;t
done its best. And yet it has done beautifully!
Why, when did you ever see such a list as
this?&rdquo; He dexterously draws from an extensive inner
breast-pocket, such as no coat but a book-agent&rsquo;s or a
shoplifter&rsquo;s would be guilty of, a wide, limp, morocco-bound
subscription-book. &ldquo;Here!&rdquo; He throws it
open upon the broad Texas pommel. &ldquo;Now, just
for curiosity, look at it&mdash;oh! you can&rsquo;t see it from
away off there, looking at it sideways!&rdquo; He gives
her a half-reproachful, half-beseeching smile and
glance, and gathers up his dropped bridle. They
come closer. Their two near shoulders approach each
other, the two elbows touch, and two dissimilar hands
hold down the leaves. The two horses playfully bite
at each other; it is their way of winking one eye.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, first, here&rsquo;s the governor&rsquo;s name; and then
his son&rsquo;s, and his nephew&rsquo;s, and his other son&rsquo;s, and
his cousin&rsquo;s. And here&rsquo;s Pierre Cormeaux, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
Baptiste Cl&eacute;ment, you know, at Carancro; and here&rsquo;s
Basilide Sexnailder, and Joseph Cantrelle, and Jacques
H&eacute;bert; see? And Gaudin, and Laprade, Blouin, and
Roussel,&mdash;old Christofle Roussel of Beau Bassin,&mdash;Duhon,
Roman and Simonette Le Blanc, and Judge
Landry, and Th&eacute;riot,&mdash;Colonel Th&eacute;riot,&mdash;Martin,
H&eacute;bert again, Robichaux, Mouton, Mouton again,
Robichaux again, Mouton&mdash;oh, I&rsquo;ve got &rsquo;em all!&mdash;Castille,
Beausoleil&mdash;cousin of yours? Yes, he said
so; good fellow, thinks you&rsquo;re the greatest woman
alive.&rdquo; The two dissimilar hands, in turning a leaf,
touch, and the smaller one leaves the book. &ldquo;And
here&rsquo;s Guilbeau, and Latiolais, and Thibodeaux, and
Soudrie, and Arcenaux&mdash;flowers of the community&mdash;&lsquo;I
gather them in,&rsquo;&mdash;and here&rsquo;s a page of C&ocirc;te
Gel&eacute;e people, and&mdash;Joe Jefferson hadn&rsquo;t got back to
the Island yet, but I&rsquo;ve got his son; see? And here&rsquo;s&mdash;can
you make out this signature? It&rsquo;s written so
small&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>Both heads,&mdash;with only the heavens and the dear
old earth-mother to see them,&mdash;both heads bend over
the book; the hand that had retreated returns, but
bethinks itself and withdraws again; the eyes of Mr.
Tarbox look across their corners at the sedate brow
so much nearer his than ever it has been before, until
that brow feels the look, and slowly draws away.
Look to your mother, Marguerite; look to her! But
Marguerite is not there, not even in Vermilionville;
nor yet in Lafayette parish; nor anywhere throughout
the wide prairies of Opelousas or Attakapas. Triumph
fills Mr. Tarbox&rsquo;s breast.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he says, restoring the book to its hiding-place,
&ldquo;seems like I ought to be satisfied with that;
doesn&rsquo;t it to you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It does; Zos&eacute;phine says so. She sees the double
meaning, and Mr. Tarbox sees that she sees it, but
must still move cautiously. So he says:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not satisfied. It&rsquo;s perfect as far as it
goes, but don&rsquo;t expect me to be satisfied with it. If
I&rsquo;ve seemed satisfied, shall I tell you why it was, my
dear&mdash;friend?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zos&eacute;phine makes no reply; but her dark eyes meeting
his for a moment, and then falling to her horse&rsquo;s
feet, seem to beg for mercy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s because,&rdquo; says Mr. Tarbox, while her heart
stands still, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;ve made&rdquo;&mdash;there is an
awful pause&mdash;&ldquo;more money without the &lsquo;A. of U. I.&rsquo;
this season than I&rsquo;ve made with it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Madame Beausoleil catches her breath, shows relief
in every feature, lifts her eyes with sudden brightness,
and exclaims:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dass good! Dass mighty good, yass! <em>&rsquo;Tis</em>
so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is; and I tell you, and you only, because
I&rsquo;m proud to believe you&rsquo;re my sincere friend. Am
I right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zos&eacute;phine busies herself with her riding-skirt, shifts
her seat a little, and with studied carelessness assents.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; her companion repeats; &ldquo;and so I tell you.
The true business man is candid to all, communicative
to none. And yet I open my heart to you. I can&rsquo;t
help it; it won&rsquo;t stay shut. And you must see, I&rsquo;m
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
sure you must, that there&rsquo;s something more in there
besides money; don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; His tone grows tender.</p>

<p>Madame Beausoleil steals a glance toward him,&mdash;a
grave, timid glance. She knows there is safety in
the present moment. Three horsemen, strangers, far
across the field in their front, are coming toward them,
and she feels an almost proprietary complacence in a
suitor whom she can safely trust to be saying just the
right nothings when those shall meet them and ride by.
She does not speak; but he says:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know there is, dear Jos&mdash;&mdash;friend!&rdquo; He
smiles with modest sweetness. &ldquo;G. W. Tarbox
doesn&rsquo;t run after money, and consequently he never
runs past much without picking it up.&rdquo; They both
laugh in decorous moderation. The horsemen are
drawing near; they are Acadians. &ldquo;I admit I love
to make money. But that&rsquo;s not my chief pleasure.
My chief pleasure is the study of human nature.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;The proper study of mankind is man.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Sole judge of truth, in endless error hurled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The glory, jest, and riddle of the world.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>&ldquo;This season I&rsquo;ve been studying these Acadian
people. And I like them! They don&rsquo;t like to be
reminded that they&rsquo;re Acadians. Well, that&rsquo;s natural;
the Creoles used to lord it over them so when the
Creoles were slave-holding planters and they were
small farmers. That&rsquo;s about past now. The Acadians
are descended from peasants, that&rsquo;s true, while
some Creoles are from the French nobility. But,
hooh! wouldn&rsquo;t any fair-minded person&rdquo;&mdash;the horsemen
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
are within earshot; they are staring at the silk
hat&mdash;&ldquo;Adjieu.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Adjieu.&rdquo; They pass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&mdash;Wouldn&rsquo;t any fair-minded person that knows
what France was two or three hundred years ago&mdash;show
you some day in the &lsquo;Album&rsquo;&mdash;about as lief be
descended from a good deal of that peasantry as from
a good deal of that nobility? I should smile! Why,
my dear&mdash;friend, the day&rsquo;s coming when the Acadians
will be counted as good French blood as there is in
Louisiana! They&rsquo;re the only white people that ever
trod this continent&mdash;island or mainland&mdash;who never
on their own account oppressed anybody. Some little
depredation on their British neighbors, out of dogged
faithfulness to their king and church,&mdash;that&rsquo;s the
worst charge you can make. Look at their history!
all poetry and pathos! Look at their character! brave,
peaceable, loyal, industrious, home-loving&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>But Zos&eacute;phine was looking at the speaker. Her
face is kindled with the inspiration of his praise. His
own eyes grow ardent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look at their women! Ah, Josephine, I&rsquo;m looking
at one! Don&rsquo;t turn away.</p>

&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t stop me, Josephine; it&rsquo;s got to come,
and come right now. I&rsquo;m a homeless man, Josephine,
tired of wandering, with a heart bigger and weaker
than I ever thought I had. I want you! I love you!
I&rsquo;ve never loved anybody before in my life except
myself, and I don&rsquo;t find myself as lovely as I used.
Oh, take me, Josephine! I don&rsquo;t ask you to love as if
you&rsquo;d never loved another. I&rsquo;ll take what&rsquo;s left, and
be perfectly satisfied! I know you&rsquo;re ambitious, and
I love you for that! But I do think I can give you a
larger life. With you for a wife, I believe I could be
a man you needn&rsquo;t be ashamed of. I&rsquo;m already at the
head of my line. Best record in the United States,
Josephine, whether by the day, week, month, year,
or locality. But if you don&rsquo;t like the line, I&rsquo;ll throw
up the &lsquo;A. of U. I.&rsquo; and go into any thing you say;
for I want to lift you higher, Josephine. You&rsquo;re above
me already, by nature and by rights, but I can lift you,
I know I can. You&rsquo;ve got no business keeping tavern;
you&rsquo;re one of Nature&rsquo;s aristocrats. Yes, you are! and
you&rsquo;re too young and lovely to stay a widow&mdash;in a
State where there&rsquo;s more men than there&rsquo;s women.
There&rsquo;s a good deal of the hill yet to climb before you
start down. Oh, let&rsquo;s climb it together, Josephine!
I&rsquo;ll make you happier than you are, Josephine; I
haven&rsquo;t got a bad habit left; such as I had, I&rsquo;ve quit;
it don&rsquo;t pay. I don&rsquo;t drink, chew, smoke, tell lies,
swear, quarrel, play cards, make debts, nor belong to
a club&mdash;be my wife! Your daughter &rsquo;ll soon be leaving
you. You can&rsquo;t be happy alone. Take me! take
me!&rdquo; He urges his horse close&mdash;her face is averted&mdash;and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
lays his hand softly but firmly on her two, resting
folded on the saddle-horn. They struggle faintly
and are still; but she slowly shakes her hanging head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O Josephine! you don&rsquo;t mean no, do you? Look
this way! you don&rsquo;t mean no?&rdquo; He presses his hand
passionately down upon hers. Her eyes do not turn
to his; but they are lifted tearfully to the vast, unanswering
sky, and as she mournfully shakes her head
again, she cries,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dunno! I dunno! I can&rsquo;t tell! I got to see
Marguerite.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ll see her in an hour, and if she&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Naw, naw! &rsquo;tis not so; Marguerite is in New
Orleans since Christmas.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Very late in the evening of that day Mr. Tarbox
entered the principal inn of St. Martinville, on the
Teche. He wore an air of blitheness which, though
silent, was overdone. As he pushed his silk hat back
on his head, and registered his name with a more than
usual largeness of hand, he remarked:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Man wants but little here below,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor wants that little long.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Give me a short piece of candle and a stumpy
candlestick&mdash;and</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Take me up, and bear me hence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into some other chamber&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Glad to see you back, Mr. Tarbox,&rdquo; responded
the host; and as his guest received the candle and
heard the number of his room,&mdash;&ldquo;books must &rsquo;a&rsquo;
went well this fine day.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
Mr. Tarbox fixed him with his eye, drew a soft step
closer, said in a low tone:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">&ldquo;&lsquo;My only books<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Were woman&rsquo;s looks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And folly&rsquo;s all they&rsquo;ve taught me.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>The landlord raised his eyebrows, rounded his mouth,
and darted out his tongue. The guest shifted the
candle to his left hand, laid his right softly upon the
host&rsquo;s arm, and murmured:</p>

<p>&ldquo;List! Are we alone? If I tell thee something,
wilt thou tell it never?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The landlord smiled eagerly, shook his head, and
bent toward his speaker.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Friend Perkins,&rdquo; said Mr. Tarbox, in muffled
voice&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;So live, that when thy summons comes to join<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The innumerable caravan which moves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To that mysterious realm where each shall take<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His chamber in the silent halls of death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou go not, like the quarry-slave, at night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scourged to his dungeon, but, sustained and soothed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By an unfaltering trust, approach thy grave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like one that wraps the drapery of his couch<br /></span>
<span class="i0">About him, and lies down to pleasant dreams.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let the newspapers get hold of it&mdash;good-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But it was only at daybreak that Mr. Tarbox disordered
the drapery of his couch to make believe he
had slept there, and at sunrise he was gone to find
Claude.</p>

<h3>&rsquo;THANASE&rsquo;S VIOLIN.</h3>


<p>Had Marguerite gone to New Orleans the better to
crush Claude out of her heart? No, no! Her mother
gave an explanation interesting and reasonable enough,
and at the same time less uncomfortably romantic.
Marguerite had gone to the city to pursue studies
taught better there than in Opelousas; especially
music.</p>

<p>Back of this was a reason which she had her
mother&rsquo;s promise not to mention,&mdash;the physician&rsquo;s
recommendation&mdash;a change of scene. He spoke of
slight malarial influences, and how many odd forms
they took; of dyspepsia and its queer freaks; of the
confining nature of house cares, and of how often they
&ldquo;ran down the whole system.&rdquo; His phrases were
French, but they had all the weary triteness of these;
while Marguerite rejoiced that he did not suspect the
real ailment, and Zos&eacute;phine saw that he divined it
perfectly.</p>

<p>A change of scene. Marguerite had treated the
suggestion lightly, as something amusingly out of
proportion to her trivial disorder, but took pains not
to reject it. Zos&eacute;phine had received it with troubled
assent, and mentioned the small sugar-farm and
orangery of the kinsman Robichaux, down on Bayou
Terrebonne. But the physician said, &ldquo;If that would
not be too dull;&rdquo; mentioned, casually, the city, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
saw Marguerite lighten up eagerly. The city was
chosen; the physician&rsquo;s sister, living there, would see
Marguerite comfortably established. All was presently
arranged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you can take your violin with you, and study
music,&rdquo; he said. Marguerite had one, and played it
with a taste and skill that knew no competitor in all
the surrounding region.</p>

<p>It had belonged to her father. Before she was
born, all Lafayette parish had known it tenderly.
Before she could talk she had danced&mdash;courtesied
and turned, tiptoed and fallen and risen again, latter
end first, to the gay strains he had loved to wring from
it. Before it seemed safe, for the instrument, to trust
it in her hands, she had learned to draw its bow; and
for years, now, there had been no resident within the
parish who could not have been her scholar better than
to be her teacher.</p>

<p>When Claude came, she had shut the violin in its
case, and left the poor thing hidden away, despising
its powers to charm, lost in self-contempt, and helpless
under the spell of a chaste passion&rsquo;s first enchantment.
When he went, she still forgot the instrument
for many days. She returned with more than dutiful
energy to her full part in the household cares, and
gave every waking hour not so filled to fierce study.
If she could not follow him&mdash;if a true maiden must
wait upon faith&mdash;at least she would be ready if fate
should ever bring him back.</p>

<p>But one night, when she had conned her simple
books until the words ran all together on the page,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
some good angel whispered, &ldquo;The violin!&rdquo; She took
it and played. The music was but a song, but from
some master of song. She played it, it may be, not
after the best rules, yet as one may play who, after
life&rsquo;s first great billow has gone over him, smites again
his forgotten instrument. With tears, of all emotions
mingled, starting from her eyes, and the bow trembling
on the strings, she told the violin her love. And it
answered her:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be strong! be strong! you shall not love for
naught. He shall&mdash;he shall come back&mdash;he shall
come back and lead us into joy.&rdquo; From that time
the violin had more employment than ever before in
all its days.</p>

<p>So it and Marguerite were gone away to the great
strange city together. The loneliness they left behind
was a sad burden to Zos&eacute;phine. No other one
thing had had so much influence to make so nearly
vulnerable the defences of her heart when Mr. Tarbox
essayed to storm them. On the night following that
event, the same that he had spent so sleeplessly in
St. Martinville, she wrote a letter to Marguerite,
which, though intended to have just the opposite
effect, made the daughter feel that this being in New
Orleans, and all the matter connected with it, were
one unmixed mass of utter selfishness. The very
written words that charged her to stay on seemed
to say, &ldquo;Come home!&rdquo; Her strong little mother!
always quiet and grave, it is true, and sometimes
sad; yet so well poised, so concentrated, so equal to
every passing day and hour!&mdash;she to seem&mdash;in this
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
letter&mdash;far out of her course, adrift, and mutely and
dimly signalling for aid! The daughter read the pages
again and again. What could they mean? Here, for
instance, this line about the mother&rsquo;s coming herself
to the city, if, and if, and if!</p>

<p>The letter found Marguerite in the bosom of a family
that dwelt in the old Rue Bourbon, only a short
way below Canal Street, the city&rsquo;s centre. The house
stands on the street, its drawing-room windows opening
upon the sidewalk, and a narrow balcony on the
story above shading them scantily at noon. A garden
on the side is visible from the street through a lofty,
black, wrought-iron fence. Of the details within the
enclosure, I remember best the vines climbing the walls
of the tall buildings that shut it in, and the urns and
vases, and the evergreen foliage of the Japan plum-trees.
A little way off, and across the street, was the
pleasant restaurant and salesroom of the Christian
Women&rsquo;s Exchange.</p>

<p>The family spoke English. Indeed, they spoke it
a great deal; and French&mdash;also a great deal. The
younger generation, two daughters and a son, went
much into society. Their name was that of an ancient
French noble house, with which, in fact, they had no
connection. They took great pains to call themselves
Creoles, though they knew well enough they were
Acadians. The Acadian caterpillar often turns into
a Creole butterfly. Their great-grandfather, one of
the children of the Nova-Scotian deportation, had been
a tobacco-farmer on the old C&ocirc;te Acadien in St. John
the Baptist parish. Lake des Allemands lay there,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
just behind him. In 1815, his son, their grandfather,
in an excursion through the lake and bayou beyond,
discovered, far south-eastward in the midst of the
Grande Prairie des Allemands, a &ldquo;pointe&rdquo; of several
hundred acres extent. Here, with one or two others,
he founded the Acadian settlement of &ldquo;La Vacherie,&rdquo;
and began to build a modest fortune. The blood was
good, even though it was not the blood of ancient robbers;
and the son in the next generation found his
way, by natural and easy stages, through Barataria
and into the city, and became the &ldquo;merchant&rdquo; of his
many sugar and rice planting kinsmen and neighbors.</p>

<p>It was a great favor to Marguerite to be taken into
such a household as this. She felt it so. The household
felt it so. Yet almost from the start they began
to play her, in their social world, as their best card&mdash;when
they could. She had her hours of school and of
home study; also her music, both lessons and practice;
was in earnest both as to books and violin, and
had teachers who also were in earnest; and so she
found little time for social revels. Almost all sociality
is revel in New-Orleans society, and especially in the
society she met.</p>

<p>But when she did appear, somehow she shone. A
native instinct in dress,&mdash;even more of it than her
mother had at the same age,&mdash;and in manners and
speech, left only so little rusticity as became itself a
charm rather than a blemish, suggested the sugar-cane
fields; the orange-grove; the plantation-house, with
pillared porch, half-hidden in tall magnolias and laurestines
and bushes of red and white camellias higher
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
and wider than arms can reach, and covered with their
regal flowers from the ground to their tops; and the
bayou front lined with moss-draped live-oaks, their
noonday shadows a hundred feet across. About her
there was not the faintest hint of the country tavern.
She was but in her seventeenth year; but on her
native prairies, where girls are women at fourteen,
seventeen was almost an advanced stage of decay.
She seemed full nineteen, and a very well-equipped
nineteen as social equipments went in the circle she
had entered. Being a schoolgirl was no drawback;
there are few New-Orleans circles where it is; and
especially not in her case, for she needed neither to
titter nor chatter,&mdash;she could talk. And then, her
violin made victory always easy and certain.</p>

<p>Sometimes the company was largely of down-town
Creoles; sometimes of up-town people,&mdash;&ldquo;Americans;&rdquo;
and often equally of the two sorts, talking
French and English in most amusing and pleasing
confusion. For the father of the family had lately
been made president of a small bank, and was fairly
boxing the social compass in search of depositors.
Marguerite had not yet discovered that&mdash;if we may
drag the metaphor ashore&mdash;to enter society is not to
emerge upon an unbroken table-land, or that she was
not on its highest plateau. She noticed the frequency
with which she encountered unaccomplished fathers,
stupid mothers, rude sons and daughters, and ill-distributed
personal regard; but she had the common-sense
not to expect more of society than its nature
warrants, guessed rightly that she would find the same
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
thing anywhere else, and could not know that these
elements were less mixed with better here than in many
other of the city&rsquo;s circles, of whose existence she had
not even heard. However:</p>

<p>Society, at its very best, always needs, and at its
best or worst always contains, a few superior members,
who make themselves a blessing by working a constant,
tactful redistribution of individuals by their true
values, across the unworthy lines upon which society
ever tends to stratify. Such a person, a matron, sat
with Marguerite one April evening under a Chinese
lantern in the wide, curtained veranda of an Esplanade-street
house whose drawing-room and Spanish garden
were filled with company.</p>

<p>Marguerite was secretly cast down. This lady had
brought her here, having met her but a fortnight before
and chosen her at once, in her own private counsels,
for social promotion. And Marguerite had played the
violin. In her four months&rsquo; advanced training she
had accomplished wonders. Her German professor
made the statement, while he warned her against enthusiastic
drawing-room flattery. This evening she
had gotten much praise and thanks. Yet these had a
certain discriminative moderation that was new to her
ear, and confirmed to her, not in the pleasantest way,
the realization that this company was of higher average
intelligence and refinement than any she had met
before. She little guessed that the best impression she
had ever made she made here to-night.</p>

<p>Of course it was not merely on account of the violin.
She had beauty, not only of face and head, but of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
form and carriage. So that when she stood with her
instrument, turning, as it were, every breath of air
into music, and the growing volume of the strains
called forth all her good Acadian strength of arms
and hand, she charmed not merely the listening ear,
but the eye, the reason, and the imagination in its
freest range.</p>

<p>But, indeed, it was not the limitations of her social
triumphs themselves that troubled her. Every experience
of the evening had helped to show her how much
wider the world was than she had dreamed, and had
opened new distances on the right, on the left, and far
ahead; and nowhere in them all could eye see, or ear
hear, aught of that one without whom to go back to
old things was misery, and to go on to new was mere
weariness. And the dear little mother at home!&mdash;worth
nine out of any ten of all this crowd&mdash;still at
home in that old tavern-keeping life, now intolerable
to think of, and still writing those yearning letters that
bade the daughter not return! No wonder Marguerite&rsquo;s
friend had divined her feelings, and drawn her
out to the cool retreat under the shadow of the veranda
lanterns.</p>

<p>A gentleman joined them, who had &ldquo;just come,&rdquo;
he said. Marguerite&rsquo;s companion and he were old
friends. Neither he nor Marguerite heard each other&rsquo;s
name, nor could see each other&rsquo;s face more than dimly.
He was old enough to be twitted for bachelorhood, and
to lay the blame upon an outdoor and out-of-town
profession. Such words drew Marguerite&rsquo;s silent but
close attention.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
The talk turned easily from this to the ease with
which the fair sex, as compared with the other, takes
on the graces of the drawing-room. &ldquo;Especially,&rdquo;
the two older ones agreed, &ldquo;if the previous lack is
due merely to outward circumstances.&rdquo; But Marguerite
was still. Here was a new thought. One who
attained all those graces and love&rsquo;s prize also might
at last, for love&rsquo;s sake, have to count them but dross,
or carry them into retirement, the only trophies of
abandoned triumphs. While she thought, the conversation
went on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said her friend, replying to the bachelor,
&ldquo;we acquire drawing-room graces more easily; but
why? Because most of us think we must. A man
may find success in one direction or another; but a
woman has got to be a social success, or she&rsquo;s a complete
failure. She can&rsquo;t snap her fingers at the
drawing-room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; exclaimed Marguerite, &ldquo;she can if she
want!&rdquo; She felt the strength to rise that moment
and go back to Opelousas, if only&mdash;and did not see,
until her companions laughed straight at her, that the
lady had spoken in jest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Still,&rdquo; said the bachelor, &ldquo;the drawing-room is
woman&rsquo;s element&mdash;realm&mdash;rather than man&rsquo;s, whatever
the reasons may be. I had a young man with me
last winter&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I knew it!&rdquo; thought Marguerite.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&mdash;until lately, in fact; he&rsquo;s here in town now,&mdash;whom
I have tried once or twice to decoy into company
in a small experimental way. It&rsquo;s harder than
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
putting a horse into a ship. He seems not to know
what social interchange is for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thinks it&rsquo;s for intellectual profit and pleasure,&rdquo;
interrupted the ironical lady.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, he just doesn&rsquo;t see the use or fun of it. And
yet, really, that&rsquo;s his only deficiency. True, he listens
better than he talks&mdash;overdoes it; but when a chap
has youth, intelligence, native refinement, integrity,
and good looks, as far above the mean level as many
of our society fellows are below it, it seems to me he
ought to be&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Utilized,&rdquo; suggested the lady, casting her eyes
toward Marguerite and withdrawing them as quickly,
amused at the earnestness of her attention.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the bachelor, and mused a moment.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a talented fellow. It&rsquo;s only a few months ago
that he really began life. Now he&rsquo;s outgrown my
service.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Left the nest,&rdquo; said the lady.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed. He has invented&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The bachelor was teased. &ldquo;Ah! come, now; show
your usual kindness; he has, really, made a simple,
modest agricultural machine that&mdash;meets a want long
felt. Oh! you may laugh; but he laughs last. He
has not only a patent for it, but a good sale also, and
is looking around for other worlds to conquer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And yet spurns society? Ours!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, simply develops no affinity for it; would like
to, if only to please me; but can&rsquo;t. Doesn&rsquo;t even
make intimate companions among men; simply clings
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
to his fond, lone father, and the lone father to him,
closer than any pair of twin orphan girls that ever you
saw. I don&rsquo;t believe any thing in life could divide
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, don&rsquo;t you trust him! Man proposes, Cupid
disposes. A girl will stick to her mother; but a man?
Why, the least thing&mdash;a pair of blue eyes, a yellow
curl&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>The bachelor gayly shook his head, and, leaning over
with an air of secrecy, said: &ldquo;A pair of blue eyes have
shot him through and through, and a yellow curl is
wound all round him from head to heel, and yet he
sticks to his father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t live,&rdquo; said the lady. Marguerite&rsquo;s hand
pressed her arm, and they rose. As the bachelor drew
the light curtain of a long window aside, that they
might pass in, the light fell upon Marguerite&rsquo;s face.
It was entirely new to him. It seemed calm. Yet instantly
the question smote him, &ldquo;What have I done?
what have I said?&rdquo; She passed, and turned to give
a parting bow. The light fell upon him. She was
right; it was Claude&rsquo;s friend, the engineer.</p>

<p>When he came looking for them a few minutes later,
he only caught, by chance, a glimpse of them, clouded
in light wraps and passing to their carriage. It was
not yet twelve.</p>

<p>Between Marguerite&rsquo;s chamber and that of one of
the daughters of the family there was a door that
neither one ever fastened. Somewhere down-stairs a
clock was striking three in the morning, when this
door softly opened and the daughter stole into
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
Marguerite&rsquo;s room in her night-robe. With her hair falling
about her, her hands unconsciously clasped, her
eyes starting, and an outcry of amazement checked
just within her open, rounded mouth, she stopped and
stood an instant in the brightly lighted chamber.</p>

<p>Marguerite sat on the bedside exactly as she had
come from the carriage, save that a white gossamer
web had dropped from her head and shoulders, and
lay coiled about her waist. Her tearless eyes were
wide and filled with painful meditation, even when she
turned to the alarmed and astonished girl before her.
With suppressed exclamations of wonder and pity the
girl glided forward, cast her arms about the sitting
figure, and pleaded for explanation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a headache,&rdquo; said Marguerite, kindly but
firmly lifting away the intwining arms.&mdash;&ldquo;No, no,
you can do nothing.&mdash;It is a headache.&mdash;Yes, I will
go to bed presently; you go to yours.&mdash;No, no&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>The night-robed girl looked for a moment more into
Marguerite&rsquo;s eyes, then sank to her knees, buried her
face in her hands, and wept. Marguerite laid her
hands upon the bowed head and looked down with dry
eyes. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she presently said again, &ldquo;it is a headache.
Go back to your bed.&mdash;No, there is nothing
to tell; only I have been very, very foolish and very,
very selfish, and I am going home to-morrow. Good-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The door closed softly between the two. Then Marguerite
sank slowly back upon the bed, closed her eyes,
and rocking her head from side to side, said again and
again, in moans that scarcely left the lips:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
&ldquo;My mother! my mother! Take me back! Oh!
take me back, my mother! my mother!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At length she arose, put off her attire, lay down to
rest, and, even while she was charging sleep with being
a thousand leagues away&mdash;slept.</p>

<p>When she awoke, the wide, bright morning filled all
the room. Had some sound wakened her? Yes, a
soft tapping came again upon her door. She lay still.
It sounded once more. For all its softness, it seemed
nervous and eager. A low voice came with it:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Marguerite!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She sprang from her pillow.&mdash;&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>While she answered, it came again,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Marguerite!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a low cry, she cast away the bed-coverings,
threw back the white mosquito-curtain and the dark
masses of her hair, and started up, lifted and opened
her arms, cried again, but with joy, &ldquo;My mother! my
mother!&rdquo; and clasped Zos&eacute;phine to her bosom.</p>

<h3>THE SHAKING PRAIRIE.</h3>


<p>Manifestly it was a generous overstatement for
Claude&rsquo;s professional friend to say that Claude had
outgrown his service. It was true only that by and by
there had come a juncture in his affairs where he could
not, without injustice to others, make a place for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
Claude which he could advise Claude to accept, and
they had parted with the mutual hope that the separation
would be transient. But the surveyor could not
but say to himself that such incidents, happening
while we are still young, are apt to be turning-points
in our lives, if our lives are going to have direction
and movement of their own at all.</p>

<p>St. Pierre had belted his earnings about him under
the woollen sash that always bound his waist, shouldered
his rifle, taken one last, silent look at the cabin
on Bayou des Acadiens, stood for a few moments
with his hand in Bonaventure&rsquo;s above one green mound
in the churchyard at Grande Pointe, given it into the
schoolmaster&rsquo;s care, and had gone to join his son. Of
course, not as an idler; such a perfect woodsman
easily made himself necessary to the engineer&rsquo;s party.
The company were sorry enough to lose him when
Claude went away; but no temptation that they could
invent could stay him from following Claude. Father
and son went in one direction, and the camp in another.</p>

<p>I must confess to being somewhat vague as to just
where they were. I should have to speak from memory,
and I must not make another slip in topography.
The changes men have made in Southern Louisiana
these last few years are great. I say nothing, again, of
the vast widths of prairie stripped of the herds and
turned into corn and cane fields: when I came, a few
months ago, to that station on Morgan&rsquo;s Louisiana
and Texas Railroad where Claude first went aboard a
railway-train, somebody had actually moved the bayou,
the swamp, and the prairie apart!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
However, the exact whereabouts of the St. Pierres
is not important to us. Mr. Tarbox, when in search
of the camp he crossed the Teche at St. Martinville,
expected to find it somewhere north-eastward, between
that stream and the Atchafalaya. But at the Atchafalaya
he found that the work in that region had been
finished three days before, and that the party had been
that long gone to take part in a new work down in
the <i>prairies tremblantes</i> of Terrebonne Parish. The
Louisiana Land Reclamation Company,&mdash;I think that
was the name of the concern projecting the scheme.
This was back in early February, you note.</p>

<p>Thither Mr. Tarbox followed. The &ldquo;Album of
Universal Information&rdquo; went along, and &ldquo;did well.&rdquo;
It made his progress rather slow, of course; but one
of Mr. Tarbox&rsquo;s many maxims was, never to make
one day pay for another when it could be made to pay
for itself, and during this season&mdash;this Louisiana
campaign, as he called it&mdash;he had developed a new
art,&mdash;making each day pay for itself several times
over.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Many of these people,&rdquo; he said,&mdash;but said it
solely and silently to himself,&mdash;&ldquo;are ignorant, shiftless,
and set in their ways; and even when they&rsquo;re not
they&rsquo;re out of the current, as it were; they haven&rsquo;t
headway; and so they never&mdash;or seldom ever&mdash;see
any way to make money except somehow in connection
with the plantations. There&rsquo;s no end of chances here
to a man that&rsquo;s got money-sense, and nerve to use
it.&rdquo; He wrote that to Zos&eacute;phine, but she wrote no
answer. A day rarely passed that he did not find
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
some man making needless loss through ignorance or
inactivity; whereupon he would simply put in the
sickle of his sharper wit, and garner the neglected
harvest. Or, seeing some unesteemed commodity that
had got out of, or had never been brought into, its best
form, time, or place, he knew at sight just how, and at
what expense, to bring it there, and brought it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give me the gains other men pass by,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll be satisfied. The saying is, &lsquo;Buy wisdom;&rsquo;
but I sell mine. I like to sell. I enjoy making money.
It suits my spirit of adventure. I like an adventure.
And if there&rsquo;s any thing I love, it&rsquo;s an adventure with
money in it! But even that isn&rsquo;t my chief pleasure:
my chief pleasure&rsquo;s the study of human nature.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;The proper study of mankind is man.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sole judge of truth, in endless error hurled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The glory, jest, and riddle of the world.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>This spoiling of Assyrian camps, so to speak, often
detained Mr. Tarbox within limited precincts for days
at a time; but &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that what time is for?&rdquo; he would
say to those he had been dealing with, as he finally
snapped the band around his pocket-book; and they
would respond, &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then he would wish them a hearty farewell,
while they were thinking that at least he might know
it was his treat.</p>

<p>Thus it was the middle of February when at Houma,
the parish seat of Terrebonne, he passed the last rootlet
of railway, and, standing finally under the blossoming
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
orange-trees of Terrebonne Bayou far down toward
the Gulf, heard from the chief of the engineering party
that Claude was not with him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t leave us; we left him; and up to the
time when we left he hadn&rsquo;t decided where he would
go or what he would do. His father and he are together,
you know, and of course that makes it harder
for them to know just how to move.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The speaker was puzzled. What could this silk-hatted,
cut-away-coated, empearled, free lance of a
fellow want with Claude? He would like to find out.
So he added, &ldquo;I may get a letter from him to-morrow;
suppose you stay with me until then.&rdquo; And, to his
astonishment, Mr. Tarbox quickly jumped at the proposition.</p>

<p>No letter came. But when the twenty-four hours
had passed, the surveyor had taken that same generous&mdash;not
to say credulous&mdash;liking for Mr. Tarbox that
we have seen him show for St. Pierre and for Claude.
He was about to start on a tour of observation eastward
through a series of short canals that span the
shaking prairies from bayou to bayou, from Terrebonne
to Lafourche, Lafourche to Des Allemands, so through
Lake Ouacha into and up Barataria, again across
prairie, and at length, leaving Lake Cataouach&eacute; on the
left, through cypress-swamp to the Mississippi River,
opposite New Orleans. He would have pressed Mr.
Tarbox to bear him company; but before he could ask
twice, Mr. Tarbox had consented. They went in a cat-rigged
skiff, with a stalwart negro rowing or towing
whenever the sail was not the best.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all of sixty miles,&rdquo; said the engineer; &ldquo;but if
the wind doesn&rsquo;t change or drop we can sleep to-night
in Achille&rsquo;s hut, send this man and skiff back, and
make Achille, with his skiff, put us on board the
Louisiana-avenue ferry-launch to-morrow afternoon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is Achille?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Achille? Oh! he&rsquo;s merely a &rsquo;Cajun pot-hunter living
on a shell bank at the edge of Lake Cataouach&eacute;,
with an Indian wife. Used to live somewhere on Bayou
des Allemands, but last year something or other scared
him away from there. He&rsquo;s odd&mdash;seems to be a sort of
self-made outcast. I don&rsquo;t suppose he&rsquo;s ever done anybody
any harm; but he just seems to be one of that kind
that can&rsquo;t bear to even try to keep up with the rest of
humanity; the sort of man swamps and shaking prairies
were specially made for, you know. He&rsquo;s living right
on top of a bank of fossil shells now,&mdash;thousands of
barrels of them,&mdash;that he knows would bring him a little
fortune if only he could command the intelligence and
the courage to market them in New Orleans. There&rsquo;s a
chance for some bright man who isn&rsquo;t already too busy.
Why didn&rsquo;t I think to mention it to Claude? But then
neither he nor his father have got the commercial
knowledge they would need. Now&rdquo;&mdash;The speaker
suddenly paused, and, as the two men sat close beside
each other under an umbrella in the stern of the skiff,
looked into Mr. Tarbox&rsquo;s pale-blue eyes, and smiled,
and smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here,&rdquo; said Mr. Tarbox.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; responded the other, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ve just made
out why! And you&rsquo;re right, Tarbox; you and Claude,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
with or without his father, will make a strong team.
You&rsquo;ve got no business to be canvassing books,
you&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my line,&rdquo; said the canvasser, smiling fondly
and pushing his hat back,&mdash;it was wonderful how he
kept that hat smooth,&mdash;&ldquo;and I&rsquo;m the head of the
line:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;A voice replied far up the height,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Excelsior!&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>I was acquainted with Mr. Longfellow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tarbox,&rdquo; persisted the engineer, driving away his
own smile, &ldquo;you know what you are; you are a born
contractor! You&rsquo;ve found it out, and&rdquo;&mdash;smiling
again&mdash;&ldquo;that&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re looking for Claude.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo; asked Mr. Tarbox.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I told you the truth when I said I didn&rsquo;t
know; but I haven&rsquo;t a doubt he&rsquo;s in Vermilionville.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Neither have I,&rdquo; said the book-agent; &ldquo;and if I
had, I wouldn&rsquo;t give it room. If I knew he was in
New Jersey, still I&rsquo;d think he was in Vermilionville,
and go there looking for him. And wherefore? For
occult reasons.&rdquo; The two men looked at each other
smilingly in the eye, and the boat glided on.</p>

<p>The wind favored them. With only now and then
the cordelle, and still more rarely the oars, they moved
all day across the lands and waters that were once the
fastnesses of the Baratarian pirates. The engineer
made his desired observations without appreciable
delays, and at night they slept under Achille&rsquo;s thatch
of rushes.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
As the two travellers stood alone for a moment next
morning, the engineer said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You seem to be making a study of my pot-hunter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my natural instinct,&rdquo; replied Mr. Tarbox.
&ldquo;The study of human nature comes just as natural to
me as it does to a new-born duck to scratch the back
of its head with its hind foot; just as natural&mdash;and
easier. The pot-hunter is a study; you&rsquo;re right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he reciprocates,&rdquo; said the engineer; &ldquo;he
studies you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The student of man held his smiling companion&rsquo;s
gaze with his own, thrust one hand into his bosom,
and lifted the digit of the other: &ldquo;The eyes are called
the windows of the soul,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;And looks commercing with the skies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy rapt soul sitting in thine eyes.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Have you tried to look into his eyes? You can&rsquo;t
do it. He won&rsquo;t let you. He&rsquo;s got something in
there that he doesn&rsquo;t want you to see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the middle of the afternoon, when Achille&rsquo;s skiff
was already re-entering the shades of the swamp on
his way homeward, and his two landed passengers
stood on the levee at the head of Harvey&rsquo;s Canal with
the Mississippi rolling by their feet and on its farther
side the masts and spires of the city, lighted by the
western sun, swinging round the long bend of her
yellow harbor, Mr. Tarbox offered his hand to say
good-by. The surveyor playfully held it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean no disparagement to your present calling,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;but the next time we meet I hope you&rsquo;ll be
a contractor.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; responded Tarbox, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not my nature.
I cannot contract; I must always expand. And yet&mdash;I
thank you.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Pure thoughts are angel visitors. Be such<br /></span>

<p>One took the ferry; the other, the west bound train
at Gretna.</p>

<h3><a name="PART_III_CHAP_IX" id="PART_III_CHAP_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX.</h3>

<h3>NOT BLUE EYES, NOR YELLOW HAIR.</h3>


<p>When the St. Pierres found themselves really left
with only each other&rsquo;s faces to look into, and the
unbounded world around them, it was the father who
first spoke:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Claude, where you t&rsquo;ink &rsquo;better go?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There had been a long, silent struggle in both men&rsquo;s
minds. And now Claude heard with joy this question
asked in English. To ask it in their old Acadian
tongue would have meant retreat; this meant advance.
And yet he knew his father yearned for Bayou des
Acadiens. Nay, not his father; only one large part
of his father&rsquo;s nature; the old, French, home-loving
part.</p>

<p>What should Claude answer? Grande Pointe? Even
for St. Pierre alone that was impossible. &ldquo;Can a
man enter a second time into his mother&rsquo;s womb?&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
No; the thatched cabin stood there,&mdash;stands there
now; but, be he happy or unhappy, no power can ever
make St. Pierre small enough again to go back into
that shell. Let it stand, the lair of one of whom you
may have heard, who has retreated straight backward
from Grande Pointe and from advancing enlightenment
and order,&mdash;the village drunkard, Chat-ou&eacute;.</p>

<p>Claude&rsquo;s trouble, then, was not that his father&rsquo;s
happiness beckoned in one direction and his in another;
but that his father&rsquo;s was linked on behind his. Could
the father endure the atmosphere demanded by the
son&rsquo;s widening power? Could the second nature of
lifetime habits bear the change? Of his higher spirit
there was no doubt. Neither father nor son had any
conception of happiness separate from noble aggrandizement.
Nay, that is scant justice; far more than
they knew, or than St. Pierre, at least, would have
acknowledged, they had caught the spirit of Bonaventure,
to call it by no higher name, and saw that the
best life for self is to live the best possible for others.
&ldquo;For all others,&rdquo; Bonaventure would have insisted;
but &ldquo;for Claude,&rdquo; St. Pierre would have amended.
They could not return to Grande Pointe.</p>

<p>Where, then, should they go? Claude stood with his
arms akimbo, looked into his father&rsquo;s face, tried to
hide his perplexity under a smile, and then glanced
at their little pile of effects. There lay their fire-arms,
the same as ever; but the bundles in Madras handkerchiefs
had given place to travelling-bags, and instead
of pots and pans here were books and instruments.
What reply did these things make? New Orleans?
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
The great city? Even Claude shrank from that
thought.</p>

<p>No, it was the name of quite a different place they
spoke; a name that Claude&rsquo;s lips dared not speak,
because, for lo! these months and months his heart
had spoken it,&mdash;spoken it at first in so soft a whisper
that for a long time he had not known it was his heart
he heard. When something within uttered and re-uttered
the place&rsquo;s name, he would silently explain to
himself: &ldquo;It is because I am from home. It is this
unfixed camp-life, this life without my father, without
Bonaventure, that does it. This is not love, of course;
I know that: for, in the first place, I was in love once,
when I was fourteen, and it was not at all like this;
and in the second place, it would be hopeless presumption
in me, muddy-booted vagabond that I am; and
in the third place, a burnt child dreads fire. And so
it cannot be love. When papa and I are once more
together, this unaccountable longing will cease.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But, instead of ceasing, it had grown. The name of
the place was still the only word the heart would venture;
but it meant always one pair of eyes, one young
face, one form, one voice. Still it was not love&mdash;oh,
no! Now and then the hospitality of some plantation-house
near the camp was offered to the engineers; and
sometimes, just to prove that this thing was not love,
he would accept such an invitation, and even meet a
pretty maiden or two, and ask them for music and
song&mdash;for which he had well-nigh a passion&mdash;and
talk enough to answer their questions and conjectures
about a surveyor&rsquo;s life, etc.; but when he got back to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
camp, matters within his breast were rather worse than
better.</p>

<p>He had then tried staying in camp, but without
benefit,&mdash;nothing cured, every thing aggravated.
And yet he knew so perfectly well that he was not in
love, that just to realize the knowledge, one evening,
when his father was a day&rsquo;s march ahead, and he was
having a pleasant chat with the &ldquo;chief,&rdquo; no one else
nigh, and they were dawdling away its closing hour
with pipes, metaphysics, psychology, and like trifles,
which Claude, of course, knew all about,&mdash;Claude told
him of this singular and amusing case of haunting
fantasy in his own experience. His hearer had shown
even more amusement than he, and had gone on smiling
every now and then afterward, with a significance
that at length drove Claude to bed disgusted with him
and still more with himself. There had been one offsetting
comfort; an unintentional implication had
somehow slipped in between his words, that the haunting
fantasy had blue eyes and yellow hair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; the angry youth had muttered, tossing
on his iron couch, &ldquo;let him think so!&rdquo; And then he
had tossed again, and said below his breath, &ldquo;It is
not love: it is not. But I must never answer its call;
if I do, love is what it will be. My father, my father!
would that I could give my whole heart to thee as thou
givest all to me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>God has written on every side of our nature,&mdash;on
the mind, on the soul, yes, and in our very flesh,&mdash;the
interdict forbidding love to have any one direction
only, under penalty of being forever dwarfed. This
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
Claude vaguely felt; but lacking the clear thought, he
could only cry, &ldquo;Oh, is it, <em>is it</em>, selfishness for one&rsquo;s
heart just to be hungry and thirsty?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And now here sat his father, on all their worldly
goods, his rifle between his knees, waiting for his son&rsquo;s
choice, and ready to make it his own. And here stood
the son, free of foot to follow that voice which was
calling to-day louder than ever before, but feeling
assured that to follow it meant love without hope for
him, and for this dear father the pain of yielding up
the larger share of his son&rsquo;s heart,&mdash;as if love were
subject to arithmetic!&mdash;yielding it to one who, thought
Claude, cared less for both of them than for one tress
of her black hair, one lash of her dark eyes. While
he still pondered, the father spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Claude, I tell you!&rdquo; his face lighted up with
courage and ambition. &ldquo;We better go&mdash;Mervilionville!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Claude&rsquo;s heart leaped, but he kept his countenance.
&ldquo;Vermilionville? No, papa; you will not like Vermilionville.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yaas! I will like him. &rsquo;Tis good place! Bonaventure
come from yondah. When I was leav&rsquo; Gran&rsquo;
Point&rsquo;, Bonaventure, he cry, you know, like I tole
you. He tell Sidonie he bringin&rsquo; ed&rsquo;cation at Gran&rsquo;
Point&rsquo; to make Gran&rsquo; Point&rsquo; more better, but now
ed&rsquo;cation drive bes&rsquo; men &rsquo;way from Gran&rsquo; Point&rsquo;. And
den he say, &lsquo;St. Pierre, may bee you go Mervilionville;
dat make me glad,&rsquo; he say: &lsquo;dat way,&rsquo; he say, &lsquo;what
I rob Peter I pay John.&rsquo; Where we go if dawn&rsquo;t
go Mervilionville? St. Martinville, Opelousas, New
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
Iberia? Too many Creole yondah for me. Can&rsquo;t go
to city; city too big to live in. Why you dawn&rsquo;t like
Mervilionville? You write me letter, when you was
yondah, you like him fus&rsquo; class!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Claude let silence speak consent. He stooped, and
began to load himself with their joint property. He
had had, in his life, several sorts of trouble of mind;
but only just now at twenty was he making the acquaintance
of his conscience. Vermilionville was the call
that had been sounding within him all these months,
and Marguerite was the haunting fantasy.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<h3><a name="PART_III_CHAP_X" id="PART_III_CHAP_X"></a>CHAPTER X.</h3>

<h3>A STRONG TEAM.</h3>


<p>I would not wish to offend the self-regard of
Vermilionville. But&mdash;what a place in which to seek
enlargement of life! I know worth and greatness
have sometimes, not to say ofttimes, emerged from
much worse spots; from little lazy villages, noisy only
on Sunday, with grimier court-houses, deeper dust and
mud, their trade more entirely in the hands of rat-faced
Isaacs and Jacobs, with more frequent huge and solitary
swine slowly scavenging about in abysmal self-occupation,
fewer vine-clad cottages, raggeder negroes,
and more decay. Vermilionville is not the worst, at
all. I have seen large, and enlarging, lives there.</p>

<p>Hither came the two St. Pierres. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; Claude
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
said; &ldquo;they would not go to the Beausoleil house.&rdquo;
Privately he would make himself believe he had not
returned to any thing named Beausoleil, but only and
simply to Vermilionville. On a corner opposite the
public square there was another &ldquo;hotel;&rdquo; and it was
no great matter to them if it was mostly pine-boards,
pale wall-paper, and transferable whitewash. But,
not to be outdone by its rival round the corner, it had,
besides, a piano, of a quality you may guess, and a
landlady&rsquo;s daughter who seven times a day played and
sang &ldquo;I want to be somebody&rsquo;s darling,&rdquo; and had no
want beyond. The travellers turned thence, found
a third house full, conjectured the same of the only
remaining one, and took their way, after all, towards
Zos&eacute;phine&rsquo;s. It was quite right, now, to go there,
thought Claude, since destiny led; and so he let it
lead both his own steps and the thrumping boots of
this dear figure in Campeachy hat and soft untrimmed
beard, that followed ever at his side.</p>

<p>And then, after all!&mdash;looking into those quiet
black eyes of Zos&eacute;phine&rsquo;s,&mdash;to hear that Marguerite
was not there! Gone! Gone to the great city, the
place &ldquo;too big to live in.&rdquo; Gone there for knowledge,
training, cultivation, larger life, and finer uses!
Gone to study an art,&mdash;an art! Risen beyond him
&ldquo;like a diamond in the sky.&rdquo; And he fool enough
to come rambling back, blue-shirted and brown-handed,
expecting to find her still a tavern maid! So, farewell
fantasy! &rsquo;Twas better so; much better. Now
life was simplified. Oh, yes; and St. Pierre made
matters better still by saying to Zos&eacute;phine:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
&ldquo;I dinn&rsquo; know you got one lill gal. Claude never
tell me &rsquo;bout dat. I spec&rsquo; dat why he dawn&rsquo;t want
&rsquo;come yeh. He dawn&rsquo;t like gal; he run f&rsquo;om &rsquo;em like
dog from yalla-jacket. He dawn&rsquo;t like none of &rsquo;m.
What he like, dass his daddy. He jus&rsquo; married to his
daddy.&rdquo; The father dropped his hand, smilingly,
upon his son&rsquo;s shoulder with a weight that would have
crushed it in had it been ordinary cast-iron.</p>

<p>Claude took the hand and held it, while Zos&eacute;phine
smiled and secretly thanked God her child was away.
In her letters to Marguerite she made no haste to mention
the young man&rsquo;s re-appearance, and presently a
small thing occurred that made it well that she had left
it untold.</p>

<p>With Claude and his father some days passed unemployed.
Yet both felt them to be heavy with significance.
The weight and pressure of new and, to them,
large conditions, were putting their inmost quality to
proof. Claude saw, now, what he could not see
before; why his friend the engineer had cast him loose
without a word of advice as to where he should go or
what he should do. It was because by asking no advice
he had really proposed to be his own master.
And now, could he do it? Dare he try it?</p>

<p>The first step he took was taken, I suppose, instinctively
rather than intelligently; certainly it was perilous:
he retreated into himself. St. Pierre found work afield,
for of this sort there was plenty; the husbandmen&rsquo;s
year, and the herders&rsquo; too, were just gathering good
momentum. But Claude now stood looking on empty-handed
where other men were busy with agricultural
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
utensils or machines; or now kept his room, whittling
out a toy miniature of some apparatus, which when
made was not like the one he had seen, at last. A
great distress began to fill the father&rsquo;s mind. There
had been a time when he could be idle and whittle, but
that time was gone by; that was at Grande Pointe; and
now for his son&mdash;for Claude&mdash;to become a lounger
in tavern quarters&mdash;Claude had not announced himself
to Vermilionville as a surveyor, or as any thing&mdash;Claude
to be a hater of honest labor&mdash;was this what
Bonaventure called civilize-ation? Better, surely better,
go back to the old pastoral life. How yearningly it
was calling them to its fragrant bosom! And almost
every thing was answering the call. The town was
tricking out its neglected decay with great trailing robes
of roses. The spade and hoe were busy in front
flower-beds and rear kitchen-gardens. Lanes were
green, skies blue, roads good. In the <i>bas fonds</i> the
oaks of many kinds and the tupelo-gums were hiding
all their gray in shimmering green; in these coverts
and in the reedy marshes, all the feathered flocks not
gone away north were broken into nesting pairs; in the
fields, crops were springing almost at the sower&rsquo;s heels;
on the prairie pastures, once so vast, now being narrowed
so rapidly by the people&rsquo;s thrift, the flocks and
herds ate eagerly of the bright new grass, and foals,
calves, and lambs stood and staggered on their first
legs, while in the door-yards housewives, hens, and
mother-geese warned away the puppies and children
from downy broods under the shade of the China-trees.
But Claude? Even his books lay unstudied, and his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
instruments gathered dust, while he pottered over two
or three little wooden things that a boy could not play
with without breaking. At last St. Pierre could bear
it no longer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Claude, dass ten days han&rsquo;-runnin&rsquo; now, we
ain&rsquo;t do not&rsquo;in&rsquo; but whittlin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Claude slowly pushed his model from him, looked,
as one in a dream, into his father&rsquo;s face, and suddenly
and for the first time saw what that father had suffered
for a fortnight. But into his own face there came no
distress; only, for a moment, a look of tender protestation,
and then strong hope and confidence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yass,&rdquo; he said, rising, &ldquo;dass true. But we
dawn&rsquo;t got whittle no mo&rsquo;.&rdquo; He pointed to the
model, then threw his strong arms akimbo and asked,
&ldquo;You know what is dat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Naw,&rdquo; replied the father, &ldquo;I dunno. I t&rsquo;ink &rsquo;taint
no real mash-in&rsquo; [machine] &rsquo;cause I dawn&rsquo;t never see
nuttin&rsquo; like dat at Belle Alliance plant-ation, neider at
Belmont; and I know, me, if anybody got one mash-in&rsquo;,
any place, for do any t&rsquo;in&rsquo; mo&rsquo; betteh or mo&rsquo; quicker,
Mistoo Walleece an&rsquo; M&rsquo;sieu Le Bourgeois dey boun&rsquo;
to &rsquo;ave &rsquo;im. Can&rsquo;t hitch nuttin&rsquo; to dat t&rsquo;ing you got
dare; she too small for a rat. What she is, Claude?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A yet stronger hope and courage lighted Claude&rsquo;s
face. He laid one hand upon the table before him
and the other upon the shoulder of his sitting companion:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Papa, if you want to go wid me to de city, we
make one big enough for two mule&rsquo;. Dass a mash-in&rsquo;&mdash;a
new mash-in&rsquo;&mdash;my mash-in&rsquo;&mdash;my invention!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
&ldquo;Invench? What dat is&mdash;invench?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some one knocked on the door. Claude lifted the
model, moved on tiptoe, and placed it softly under
the bed. As he rose and turned again with reddened
face, a card was slipped under the door. He took it
and read, in a pencil scrawl,&mdash;</p>

<p>
&ldquo;State Superintendent of Public Education,&rdquo;&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p>looked at his father with a broad grin, and opened the
door.</p>

<p>Mr. Tarbox had come at the right moment. There
was a good hour and a half of the afternoon still left,
and he and Claude took a walk together. Beyond a
stile and a frail bridge that spanned a gully at one end
of the town, a noble avenue of oaks leads toward
Vermilion River. On one side of this avenue the
town has since begun to spread, but at that time there
were only wide fields on the right hand and on the
left. At the farther end a turn almost at right angles
to the left takes you through a great gate and across
the railway, then along a ruined hedge of roses, and
presently into the oak-grove of the old ex-governor&rsquo;s
homestead. This was their walk.</p>

<p>By the time they reached the stile, Claude had
learned that his friend was at the head of his line, and
yet had determined to abandon that line for another</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Far up the height&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Excelsior!&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Also that his friend had liked him, had watched him,
would need him, and was willing then and there to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
assure him a modest salary, whose amount he specified,
simply to do whatever he might call upon him to
do in his (Claude&rsquo;s) &ldquo;line.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were walking slowly, and now and then slower
still. As they entered the avenue of oaks, Claude
declined the offer. Then they went very slowly indeed.
Claude learned that Mr. Tarbox, by some
chance not explained, had been in company with his
friend the engineer; that the engineer had said, &ldquo;Tarbox,
you&rsquo;re a born contractor,&rdquo; and that Claude and
he would make a &ldquo;strong team;&rdquo; that Mr. Tarbox&rsquo;s
favorite study was human nature; that he knew talent
when he saw it; had studied Claude; had fully expected
him to decline to be his employee, and liked
him the better for so doing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was just a kind of test vote; see?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Mr. Tarbox offered Claude a partnership; not
an equal one, but withal a fair interest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to commence small and branch out
gradually; see?&rdquo; And Claude saw.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, you wonder why I don&rsquo;t go in alone. Well,
I&rsquo;ll tell you; and when I tell you, I&rsquo;ll astonish you. I
lack education! Now, Claude, I&rsquo;m taking you into my
confidence. You&rsquo;ve done nothing but go to school and
study for about six years. I had a different kind of
father from yours; I never got one solid year&rsquo;s schooling,
all told, in my life. I&rsquo;ve picked up cords of
information, but an ounce of education&rsquo;s worth a ton
of information. Don&rsquo;t you believe that? eh? it is so!
I say it, and I&rsquo;m the author of the A. of U. I. I like
to call it that, because it brings you and I so near
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
together; see?&rdquo; The speaker smiled, was still, and
resumed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I need you. And I&rsquo;m just as sure you
need me. I need not only the education you have now,
but what you&rsquo;re getting every day. When you see me
you see a man who is always looking awa-a-ay ahead.
I see what you&rsquo;re going to be, and I&rsquo;m making this
offer to the Claude St. Pierre of the future.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Tarbox waited for a reply. The avenue had
been passed, the railway crossed, and the hedge skirted.
They loitered slowly into the governor&rsquo;s grove, under
whose canopy the beams of the late afternoon sun were
striking and glancing. But all their light seemed
hardly as much as that which danced in the blue eyes
of Mr. Tarbox while Claude slowly said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dunno if we can fix dat. I was glad to see you
comin&rsquo;. I reckon you jus&rsquo; right kind of man I want.
I jus&rsquo; make a new invention. I t&rsquo;ink &rsquo;f you find dat&rsquo;s
good, dat be cawntrac&rsquo; enough for right smart while.
And beside&rsquo;, I t&rsquo;ink I invent some mo&rsquo; b&rsquo;fo&rsquo; long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Mr. Tarbox was not rash. He only asked quiet
and careful questions for some time. The long sunset
was sending its last rays across the grove-dotted land,
and the birds in every tree were filling the air with their
sunset song-burst, when the two friends re-entered the
avenue of oaks. They had agreed to join their fortunes.
Now their talk drifted upon other subjects.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I came back to Vermilionville purposely to see
you,&rdquo; said Mr. Tarbox. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll tell you privately,
you wasn&rsquo;t the only cause of my coming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Claude looked at him suddenly. Was this another
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
haunted man? Were there two men haunted, and only
one fantasy? He felt ill at ease. Mr. Tarbox saw,
but seemed not to understand. He thought it best to
speak plainly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m courting her, Claude; and I think I&rsquo;m going
to get her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Claude stopped short, with jaws set and a bad look
in his eye.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Git who?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Mr. Tarbox was calm&mdash;even complacent. He
pushed his silk hat from his forehead, and said:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">... &ldquo;&lsquo;One made up<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of loveliness alone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A woman, of her gentle sex<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The seeming paragon.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>I refer to the Rose of Vermilionville, the Pearl of the
Parish, the loveliest love and fairest fair that ever
wore the shining name of Beausoleil. She&rsquo;s got to
change it to Tarbox, Claude. Before yon sun has run
its course again, I&rsquo;m going to ask her for the second
time. I&rsquo;ve just begun asking, Claude; I&rsquo;m going to
keep it up till she says yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not yondah!&rdquo; snarled Claude, with the frown
and growl of a mastiff. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s gone to de city.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Tarbox gazed a moment in blank amazement.
Then he slowly lifted his hat from his head, expanded
his eyes, drew a long slow groan, turned slowly half
around, let the inhalation go in a long keen whistle,
and cried:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! taste! taste! Who&rsquo;s got the taste? What
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
do you take me for? Who <em>are</em> you talking about?
That little monkey? Why, man alive, it&rsquo;s the mother
I&rsquo;m after. Ha, ha, ha!&rdquo;</p>

<p>If Claude said any thing in reply, I cannot imagine
what it was. Mr. Tarbox had a right to his opinion
and taste, if taste it could be called, and Claude was
helpless to resent it, even in words; but for hours
afterward he execrated his offender&rsquo;s stupidity, little
guessing that Mr. Tarbox, in a neighboring chamber,
alone and in his night-robe, was bending, smiting his
thigh in silent merriment, and whispering to himself:</p>

<p>&ldquo;He thinks I&rsquo;m an ass! He thinks I&rsquo;m an ass!
He can&rsquo;t see that I was simply investigating him!&rdquo;</p>

<h3><a name="PART_III_CHAP_XI" id="PART_III_CHAP_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI.</h3>

<h3>HE ASKS HER AGAIN.</h3>


<p>Claude and his father left the next day,&mdash;Saturday.
Only the author of the A. of U. I. knew whither they
were gone. As they were going he said very privately
to Claude:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be with you day after to-morrow. You can&rsquo;t
be ready for me before then, and you and your father
can take Sunday to look around, and kind o&rsquo; see the
city. But don&rsquo;t go into the down-town part; you&rsquo;ll
not like it; nothing but narrow streets and old buildings
with histories to &rsquo;em, and gardens hid away inside
of &rsquo;em, and damp archways, and pagan-looking
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
females who can&rsquo;t talk English, peeping out over
balconies that offer to drop down on you, and then
don&rsquo;t keep their word; every thing old-timey, and
Frenchy, and Spanishy; unprogressive&mdash;you wouldn&rsquo;t
like it. Go up-town. That&rsquo;s American. It&rsquo;s new and
fresh. There you&rsquo;ll find beautiful mansions, mostly
frame, it&rsquo;s true, but made to look like stone, you
know. There you&rsquo;ll see wealth! There you&rsquo;ll get
the broad daylight&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;The merry, merry sunshine, that makes the heart so gay.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>See? Yes, and Monday we&rsquo;ll meet at Jones&rsquo;s, 17
Tchoupitoulas Street; all right; I&rsquo;ll be on hand. But
to-day and to-morrow&mdash;&lsquo;Alabama&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;here I rest.&rsquo;
I feel constrained&rdquo;&mdash;he laid his hand upon his heart,
closed one eye, and whispered&mdash;&ldquo;to stay. I would
fain spend the sabbath in sweet Vermilionville. You
get my idea?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sabbath afternoon, beyond the town, where
Mr. Tarbox strolled, was lovelier than can be told.
Yet he was troubled. Zos&eacute;phine had not thus far
given him a moment alone. I suppose, when a hundred
generations more have succeeded us on the
earth, lovers will still be blind to the fact that women
do not do things our way. How can they? That
would be capitulation at once, and even we should
find the whole business as stupid as shooting barnyard
fowls.</p>

<p>Zos&eacute;phine had walked out earlier than Tarbox. He
had seen her go, but dared not follow. He read &ldquo;thou
shalt not&rdquo; as plain as print on her back as she walked
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
quietly away; that same little peremptory back that
once in her father&rsquo;s cal&egrave;che used to hold itself stiff
when &rsquo;Thanase rode up behind. The occasional townsman
that lifted his slouch hat in deep deference to her
silent bow, did not read unusual care on her fair brow;
yet she, too, was troubled.</p>

<p>Marguerite! she was the trouble. Zos&eacute;phine knew
her child could never come back to these old surroundings
and be content. The mother was not willing she
should. She looked at a photograph that her daughter
had lately sent her. What a change from the child
that had left her! It was like the change from a leaf
to a flower. There was but one thing to do: follow
her. So Zos&eacute;phine had resolved to sell the inn. She
was gone, now, to talk with the old ex-governor about
finding a purchaser. Her route was not by the avenue
of oaks, but around by a northern and then eastern
circuit. She knew Mr. Tarbox must have seen her
go; had a genuine fear that he would guess whither
she was bound, and yet, deeper down in her heart than
woman ever lets soliloquy go, was willing he should.
For she had another trouble. We shall come to that
presently.</p>

<p>Her suitor walked in the avenue of oaks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; he reckoned to himself, &ldquo;to consult
the governor about something, and she&rsquo;ll come back
this way.&rdquo; He loitered out across fields, but not too
far off or out of sight; and by and by there she came,
with just the slightest haste in her walk. She received
him with kindly reserve, and they went more slowly,
together.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
She told where she had been, and that the governor
approved a decision she had made.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yass; I goin&rsquo; sell my hotel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s right!&rdquo; exclaimed her companion, with joy;
&ldquo;and you&rsquo;re right!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, &rsquo;tain&rsquo;t sold yet,&rdquo; she responded. She did
not smile as she looked at him. He read trouble;
some trouble apart from the subject, in her quiet,
intense eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know sombodie want buy dat?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find some one,&rdquo; he promptly replied. Then
they talked a little about the proper price for it, and
then were very still until Mr. Tarbox said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I walked out here hoping to meet you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Madame Beausoleil looked slightly startled, and then
bowed gravely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; I want your advice. It&rsquo;s only business, but
it&rsquo;s important, and it&rsquo;s a point where a woman&rsquo;s
instinct is better than a man&rsquo;s judgment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was some melancholy satire in her responding
smile; but it passed away, and Mr. Tarbox went
on:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You never liked my line of business&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>Zos&eacute;phine interrupted with kind resentment:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; I know you didn&rsquo;t. You&rsquo;re one of the few
women whose subscription I&rsquo;ve sought in vain. Till
then I loved my business. I&rsquo;ve never loved it since.
I&rsquo;ve decided to sell out and quit. I&rsquo;m going into
another business, one that you&rsquo;ll admire. I don&rsquo;t say
any thing about the man going into it,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Honor and shame from no condition rise:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Act well your part; there all the honor lies,&rsquo;&mdash;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>but I want your advice about the party I think of
going in with. It&rsquo;s Claude St. Pierre.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zos&eacute;phine turned upon the speaker a look of steady
penetration. He met it with a glance of perfect confiding.
&ldquo;She sees me,&rdquo; he said, at the same time,
far within himself.</p>

<p>It was as natural to Mr. Tarbox to spin a web as it
is for a spider. To man&oelig;uvre was the profoundest
instinct of his unprofound nature. Zos&eacute;phine felt the
slender threads weaving around her. But in her heart
of hearts there was a certain pleasure in being snared.
It could not, to her, seem wholly bad for Tarbox to
play spider, provided he should play the harmless
spider. Mr. Tarbox spoke again, and she listened
amiably.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Claude is talented. He has what I haven&rsquo;t; I
have what he hasn&rsquo;t, and together we could make each
other&rsquo;s fortunes, if he&rsquo;s only the square, high-style
fellow I think he is. I&rsquo;m a student of human nature,
and I think I&rsquo;ve made him out. I think he&rsquo;ll do to tie
to. But will he? You can tell me. You read people
by instinct. I ask you just as a matter of business
advice and in business confidence. What do you think?
Will you trust me and tell me&mdash;as my one only trusted
friend&mdash;freely and fully&mdash;as I would tell you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Madame Beausoleil felt the odds against her, but she
looked into her companion&rsquo;s face with bright, frank
eyes and said: &ldquo;Yass, I t&rsquo;ink yass; I t&rsquo;ink <em>&rsquo;tis</em> so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks!&rdquo; said her friend, with unnecessary fervor
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
and tenderness. &ldquo;Then Claude will be my partner,
unless&mdash;my dear friend, shall you be so kind&mdash;I
might almost say confiding&mdash;to me, and me not tell
you something I think you&rsquo;d ought to know? For I
hope we are always to be friends; don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yass,&rdquo; she said, very sadly and sweetly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks! And if Claude and I become partners
that will naturally bring him into our circle, as it
were; see?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The little madame looked up with a sudden austere
exaltation of frame and intensity of face, but her companion
rushed on with&mdash;&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m going to tell you,
let the risk to me be what it may, that it may result in
great unhappiness to Claude; for he loves your daughter,
who, I know, you must think too good for him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Madame Beausoleil blushed as though she herself
were Marguerite and Tarbox were Claude.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! love Marguerite! Naw, naw! He dawn&rsquo;t
love noboddie but hees papa! Hees papa tell me dat!
Ah! naw, &rsquo;tis <em>not</em> so!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Tarbox stopped still; and when Zos&eacute;phine saw
they were in the shadow of the trees while all about
them was brightened by the momentary Southern twilight,
she, too, stopped, and he spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What brought Claude back here when by right he
should have gone straight to the city? You might
have guessed it when you saw him.&rdquo; He paused to
let her revolve the thought, and added in his own
mind&mdash;&ldquo;If you had disliked the idea, you&rsquo;d &rsquo;a&rsquo; suspected
him quick enough&rdquo;&mdash;and was pleased. He
spoke again. &ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t stop with guessing.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
Zos&eacute;phine looked up to his face from the little foot
that edgewise was writing nothings in the dust.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; continued her companion: &ldquo;I walked with
him two evenings ago in this avenue, and right where
we stand now, without his ever knowing it&mdash;then or
now&mdash;he as good as told me. Yes, Josephine, he
dares to love your beautiful and accomplished daughter!
The thought may offend you, but&mdash;was I not right to
tell you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She nodded and began to move slowly on, he following.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not betraying anyone&rsquo;s confidence,&rdquo; persisted
he; &ldquo;and I can&rsquo;t help but have a care for you. Not
that you need it, or anybody&rsquo;s. You can take care
of yourself if any man or woman can. Every time
your foot touches the ground it says so as plain as
words. That&rsquo;s what first caught my fancy. You
haven&rsquo;t got to have somebody to take care of you.
O Josephine! that&rsquo;s just why I want to take care of
you so bad! I can take care of myself, and I used
to like to do it; I was just that selfish and small; but
love&rsquo;s widened me. I can take care of myself; but,
oh! what satisfaction is there in it? Is there any?
Now, I ask you! It may do for you, for you&rsquo;re worth
taking care of; but I want to take care of something
I needn&rsquo;t be ashamed to love!&rdquo; He softly stole her
hand as they went. She let it stay, yet looked away
from him, up through the darkling branches, and distressfully
shook her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, Josephine!&mdash;don&rsquo;t do that. I want you
to take care of me. You could do better, I know, if
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
love wasn&rsquo;t the count; but when it comes to loving
you, I&rsquo;m the edition deloox! I know you&rsquo;ve an
aspiring nature, but so have I; and I believe with you
to love and you loving me, and counselling and guiding
me, I could climb high. O Josephine! it isn&rsquo;t this
poor Tarbox I&rsquo;m asking you to give yourself to; it&rsquo;s
the Tarbox that is to be; it&rsquo;s the coming Tarbox!
Why, it&rsquo;s even a good business move! If it wasn&rsquo;t
I wouldn&rsquo;t say a word! You know I can, and will
take the very best care of every thing you&rsquo;ve got; and
I know you&rsquo;ll take the same of mine. It&rsquo;s a good
move, every way. Why, here&rsquo;s every thing just fixed
for it! Listen to the mocking-bird! See him yonder,
just at the right of the stile. See! O Josephine!
don&rsquo;t you see he isn&rsquo;t</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Still singing where the weeping willow waves&rsquo;?<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>he&rsquo;s on the myrtle; the myrtle, Josephine, and the
crape-myrtle at that!&mdash;widowhood unwidowed!&mdash;Now
he&rsquo;s on the fence&mdash;but he&rsquo;ll not stay there,&mdash;and
you mustn&rsquo;t either!&rdquo; The suitor smiled at his
own ludicrousness, yet for all that looked beseechingly
in earnest. He stood still again, continuing to hold
her hand. She stole a furtive glance here and there
for possible spectators. He smiled again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t see anybody; the world waives its
claim.&rdquo; But there was such distress in her face that
his smile passed away, and he made a new effort
to accommodate his suit to her mood. &ldquo;Josephine,
there&rsquo;s no eye on us except it&rsquo;s overhead. Tell me
this; if he that was yours until ten years ago was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
looking down now and could speak to us, don&rsquo;t you
believe he&rsquo;d say yes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! I dunno. Not to-day! Not <em>dis</em> day!&rdquo; The
widow&rsquo;s eyes met his gaze of tender inquiry and then
sank to the ground. She shook her head mournfully.
&ldquo;Naw, naw; not dis day. &rsquo;Tis to-day &rsquo;Thanase was
kill&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Tarbox relaxed his grasp and Zos&eacute;phine&rsquo;s hand
escaped. She never had betrayed to him so much
distress as filled her face now. &ldquo;De man what kill&rsquo;
him git away! You t&rsquo;ink I git marrie&rsquo; while dat man
alive? Ho-o-o! You t&rsquo;ink I let Marguerite see me
do dat! Ah! naw!&rdquo; She waved him away and
turned to leave the spot, but he pressed after, and she
paused once more. A new possibility lighted his eyes.
He said eagerly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Describe the man to me. Describe him. How
tall was he? How old would he be now? Did they
try to catch him? Did you hear me talking yesterday
about a man? Is there any picture of him? Have
you got one? Yes, you have; it&rsquo;s in your pocket now
with your hand on it. Let me see it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! I di&rsquo;n&rsquo; want you to see dat!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t suppose, as far as you know yourself,
you did.&rdquo; He received it from her, and with his eyes
still on her, continued: &ldquo;No, but you knew that if I
got a ghost of a chance, I&rsquo;d see you alone. You knew
what I&rsquo;d ask you;&mdash;yes, you did, Josephine, and you
put this thing into your pocket to make it easier to say
no.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hah! easier! Hah! easier! I need somethin&rsquo; to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
<em>help</em> me do dat? Hah! &rsquo;Tis <em>not</em> so!&rdquo; But the weakness
of the wordy denial was itself almost a confession.</p>

<p>They moved on. A few steps brought them into
better light. Mr. Tarbox looked at the picture.
Zos&eacute;phine saw a slight flash of recognition. He
handed it back in silence, and they walked on, saying
not a word until they reached the stile. But there,
putting his foot upon it to bar the way, he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Josephine, the devil never bid so high for me
before in his life as he&rsquo;s bidding for me now. And
there&rsquo;s only one thing in the way; he&rsquo;s bid too late.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her eyes flashed with injured resentment. &ldquo;Ah,
you! you dawn&rsquo;t know not&rsquo;n&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo; But he interrupted:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop, I don&rsquo;t mean more than just what I say.
Six years ago&mdash;six and a half&mdash;I met a man of a
kind I&rsquo;d never met, to know it, before. You know
who&rsquo; I mean, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bonaventure?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. That meeting made a turning-point in my
life. You&rsquo;ve told me that whatever is best in you,
you owe to him. Well, knowing him as I do, I can
believe it; and if it&rsquo;s true, then it&rsquo;s the same with me;
for first he, and then you, have made another man out
of me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, naw! Bonaventure, may<em>be</em>; but not me;
ah, naw!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I tell you, yes! you, Josephine! I&rsquo;m poor
sort enough yet; but I could have done things once
that I can&rsquo;t do now. There was a time when if some
miserable outlaw stood, or even seemed, maybe, to
stand between me and my chances for happiness, I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
could have handed him over to human justice, so
called, as easy as wink; but now? No, never any
more! Josephine, I know that man whose picture I&rsquo;ve
just looked at. I could see you avenged. I could lay
my hands, and the hands of the law, on him inside of
twenty-four hours. You say you can&rsquo;t marry till the
law has laid its penalties on him, or at least while he
lives and escapes them. Is that right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zos&eacute;phine had set her face to oppose his words only
with unyielding silence, but the answer escaped her:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yass, <em>&rsquo;tis</em> so. &rsquo;Tis ri-ght!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Josephine. I know you <em>feel</em> as if it were;
but you don&rsquo;t <em>think</em> so. No, you don&rsquo;t; I know you
better in this matter than you know yourself, and you
don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s right. You know justice belongs to
the State, and that when you talk to yourself about
what <em>you</em> owe to justice, it means something else that
you&rsquo;re too sweet and good to give the right name to,
and still want it. You don&rsquo;t want it; you don&rsquo;t want
revenge, and here&rsquo;s the proof; for, Josephine, you
know, and I know, that if I&mdash;even without speaking&mdash;with
no more than one look of the eye&mdash;should
offer to buy your favor at that price, even ever so lawfully,
you&rsquo;d thank me for one minute, and then loathe
me to the end of your days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zos&eacute;phine&rsquo;s face had lost its hardness. It was drawn
with distress. With a gesture of repulsion and pain
she exclaimed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I di&rsquo;n&rsquo; mean&mdash;I di&rsquo;n&rsquo; mean&mdash;Ah!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What? private revenge? No, of course you didn&rsquo;t!
But what else would it be? O Josephine! don&rsquo;t
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
I know you didn&rsquo;t mean it? Didn&rsquo;t I tell you so?
But I want you to go farther. I want you to put away
forever the <em>feeling</em>. I want to move and stand between
you and it, and say&mdash;whatever it costs me to say it&mdash;&lsquo;God
forbid!&rsquo; I do say it; I say it now. I can&rsquo;t say
more; I can&rsquo;t say less; and somehow,&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know
how&mdash;wherever you learned it&mdash;I&rsquo;ve learned it from
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zos&eacute;phine opened her lips to refuse; but they closed
and tightened upon each other, her narrowed eyes sent
short flashes out upon his, and her breath came and
went long and deep without sound. But at his last
words she saw&mdash;the strangest thing&mdash;to be where she
saw it&mdash;a tear&mdash;<em>tears</em>&mdash;standing in his eyes; saw
them a moment, and then could see them no more for
her own. Her lips relaxed, her form drooped, she
lifted her face to reply, but her mouth twitched; she
could not speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so foolish as I look,&rdquo; he said, trying to
smile away his emotion. &ldquo;If the State chooses to
hunt him out and put him to trial and punishment,
I don&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;d stand in the way; that&rsquo;s the State&rsquo;s
business; that&rsquo;s for the public safety. But it&rsquo;s too
late&mdash;you and Bonnyventure have made it too late&mdash;for
me to help any one, least of all the one I love, to
be revenged.&rdquo; He saw his words were prevailing and
followed them up. &ldquo;Oh! you don&rsquo;t need it any more
than you really want it, Josephine. You mustn&rsquo;t ever
look toward it again. I throw myself and my love
across the path. Don&rsquo;t walk over us. Take my hand;
give me yours; come another way; and if you&rsquo;ll let
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
such a poor excuse for a teacher and guide help you,
I&rsquo;ll help you all I can, to learn to say &lsquo;forgive us our
trespasses.&rsquo; You can begin, now, by forgiving me. I
may have thrown away my last chance with you, but
I can&rsquo;t help it; it&rsquo;s my love that spoke. And if I have
spoiled all and if I&rsquo;ve got to pay for the tears you&rsquo;re
shedding with the greatest disappointment of my life,
still I&rsquo;ve had the glory and the sanctification of loving
you. If I must say, I can say,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis better to have loved and lost<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than never to have loved at all.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Must I? Are you going to make me say that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zos&eacute;phine, still in tears, silently and with drooping
head pushed her way across the stile and left him
standing on the other side. He sent one pleading
word after her:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it most too late to go the rest of the way
alone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She turned, lifted her eyes to his for an instant, and
nodded. In a twinkling he was at her side. She
glanced at him again and said quite contentedly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yass; <em>&rsquo;tis</em> so,&rdquo; and they went the short remnant
of the way together.</p>

<h3><a name="PART_III_CHAP_XII" id="PART_III_CHAP_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII.</h3>

<h3>THE BEAUSOLEILS AND ST. PIERRES.</h3>


<p>You think of going to New Orleans in the spring.
Certainly, the spring is the time to go. When you
find yourself there go some day for luncheon&mdash;if they
haven&rsquo;t moved it, there is talk of that,&mdash;go to the
Christian Women&rsquo;s Exchange, already mentioned, in the
Rue Bourbon,&mdash;French Quarter. You step immediately
from the sidewalk into the former drawing-room of
a house built early in the century as a fashionable residence.
That at least is its aspect. Notice, for
instance, in the back parlor, crowded now, like the
front one, with eating-tables, a really interesting old
wooden mantelpiece. Of course this is not the way
persons used to go in old times. They entered by the
porte-coch&egrave;re and open carriage-way upon which these
drawing-rooms still open by several glass doors on your
right. Step out there. You find a veranda crowded
with neat white-clothed tables. Before some late alterations
there was a great trellis full of green sunshine
and broken breezes entangled among vines of trumpet-creeper
and the Scuppernong grape. Here you will
be waited on, by small, blue-calico-robed damsels of
Methodist unsophistication and Presbyterian propriety,
to excellent refreshment; only, if you know your soul&rsquo;s
true interest, eschew their fresh bread and insist on
having yesterday&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>However, that is a matter of taste there, and no
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
matter at all here. All I need to add is that there are
good apartments overhead to be rented to women too
good for this world, and that in the latter end of
April, 1884, Zos&eacute;phine and Marguerite Beausoleil here
made their home.</p>

<p>The tavern was sold. The old life was left far
behind. They had done that dreadful thing that everybody
deprecates and everybody likes to do&mdash;left the
country and come to live in the city. And Zos&eacute;phine
was well pleased. A man who had tried and failed
to be a merchant in the city, he and his wife, took the
tavern; so Zos&eacute;phine had not reduced the rural population&mdash;had
not sinned against &ldquo;stastistics.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Besides, she had the good conscience of having fled
from Mr. Tarbox&mdash;put U. and I. apart, as it were&mdash;and
yet without being so hid but a suitor&rsquo;s proper
persistency could find her. Just now he was far away
prosecuting the commercial interests of Claude&rsquo;s one
or two inventions; but he was having great success;
he wrote once or twice&mdash;but got no reply&mdash;and hoped
to be back within a month.</p>

<p>When Marguerite, after her mother&rsquo;s receipt of each
of these letters, thought she saw a cloud on her brow,
Zos&eacute;phine explained, with a revival of that old look
of sweet self-command which the daughter so loved to
see, that they contained matters of business not at
all to be called troubles. But the little mother did
not show the letters. She could not; Marguerite did
not even know their writer had changed his business.
As to Claude, his name was never mentioned. Each
supposed the other was ignorant that he was in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
city, and because he was never mentioned each one
knew the other was thinking of him.</p>

<p>Ah, Claude! what are you thinking of? Has not
your new partner in business told you they are here?
No, not a word of it. &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll keep till I get back,&rdquo;
Mr. Tarbox had said to himself; and such shrewdness
was probably not so ungenerous, after all. &ldquo;If you
want a thing done well, do it yourself,&rdquo; he said one
evening to a man who could not make out what he
was driving at; and later Mr. Tarbox added to himself,
&ldquo;The man that flies the kite must hold the
thread.&rdquo; And so he kept his counsel.</p>

<p>But that does not explain. For we remember that
Claude already knew that Marguerite was in the city,
at least had her own mother&rsquo;s word for it. Here,
weeks had passed. New Orleans is not so large; its
active centre is very small. Even by accident, on the
street, Canal Street especially, he should have seen her
time and again.</p>

<p>And he did not; at any rate not to know it. She
really kept very busy indoors; and in other doors so
did he. More than that, there was his father. When
the two first came to the city St. Pierre endured the
town for a week. But it was martyrdom, doing it.
Claude saw this. Mr. Tarbox was with him the latter
part of the week. He saw it. He gave his suggestive
mind to it for one night. The next day St. Pierre
and he wandered off in street-cars and on foot, and by
the time the sun went down again a new provision had
been made. At about ninety minutes&rsquo; jaunt from the
city&rsquo;s centre, up the river, and on its farther shore,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
near where the old &ldquo;Company Canal&rdquo; runs from a
lock in the river bank, back through the swamps and
into the Baratarian lakes, St. Pierre had bought
with his lifetime savings a neat house and fair-sized
orangery. No fields? None:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see, bom-bye [by-and-by] Claude git doze
new mash-in&rsquo; all right, he go to ingineerin&rsquo; agin, and
him and you [Tarbox] be takin&rsquo; some cawntrac&rsquo; for
buil&rsquo; levee or break up old steamboat, or raise somet&rsquo;in&rsquo;
what been sunk, or somet&rsquo;in&rsquo; dat way. And den he
certain&rsquo; want somboddie to boss gang o&rsquo; fellows.
And den he say, &lsquo;Papa, I want you.&rsquo; And den I
say how I got fifty arpent&rsquo; [42 acres] rice in field.
And den he say, &lsquo;How I goin&rsquo; do widout you?&rsquo; And
den dare be fifty arpent&rsquo; rice gone!&rdquo; No, no fields.</p>

<p>Better: here with the vast wet forest at his back;
the river at his feet; the canal, the key to all Barataria,
Lafourche, and Terrebonne, full of Acadian
fishermen, hunters, timber-cutters, moss-gatherers, and
the like; the great city in sight from yonder neighbor&rsquo;s
balustraded house-top; and Claude there to rally to
his side or he to Claude&rsquo;s at a moment&rsquo;s warning; he
would be an operator&mdash;think of that!&mdash;not of the
telegraph; an operator in the wild products of the
swamp, the <i>prairies tremblantes</i>, the lakes, and in
the small harvests of the <i>pointes</i> and bayou margins:
moss, saw-logs, venison, wild-duck, fish, crabs, shrimp,
melons, garlic, oranges, P&eacute;rique tobacco. &ldquo;Knowledge
is power;&rdquo; he knew wood, water, and sky by
heart, spoke two languages, could read and write,
and understood the ways and tastes of two or three
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
odd sorts of lowly human kind. Self-command is
dominion; I do not say the bottle went never to his
lips, but it never was lifted high. And now to the
blessed maxim gotten from Bonaventure he added
one given him by Tarbox: &ldquo;In h-union ees strank!&rdquo;
Not mere union of hands alone; but of counsels!
There were Claude and Tarbox and he!</p>

<p>For instance; at Mr. Tarbox&rsquo;s suggestion Claude
brought to his father from the city every evening, now
the &ldquo;Picayune&rdquo; and now the &ldquo;Times-Democrat.&rdquo;
From European and national news he modestly turned
aside. Whether he read the book-notices I do not
know; I hope not. But when he had served supper&mdash;he
was a capital camp cook&mdash;and he and Claude had
eaten, and their pipes were lighted, you should have
seen him scanning the latest quotations and debating
the fluctuations of the moss market, the shrimp market,
and the garlic market.</p>

<p>Thus Claude was rarely in the city save in the busy
hours of the day. Much oftener than otherwise, he
saw the crimson sunsets, and the cool purple sunrises
as he and St. Pierre pulled in the father&rsquo;s skiff diagonally
to or fro across the Mississippi, between their
cottage and the sleepy outposts of city street-cars,
just under the levee at the edge of that green oak-dotted
plain where a certain man, as gentle, shy, and
unworldly as our engineer friend thought Claude to
be, was raising the vast buildings of the next year&rsquo;s
Universal Exposition.</p>

<p>But all this explains only why Claude did not, to
his knowledge, see Marguerite by accident. Yet by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
intention! Why not by intention? First, there was
his fear of sinning against his father&rsquo;s love. That
alone might have failed to hold him back; but, second,
there was his helplessness. Love made Tarbox, if any
thing were needed to make him, brave; it made Claude
a coward. And third, there was that helpless terror
of society in general, of which we have heard his
friend talk. I have seen a strong horse sink trembling
to the earth at the beating of an empty drum.
Claude looked with amazed despair at a man&rsquo;s ability
to overtake a pretty girl acquaintance in Canal Street,
and walk and talk with her. He often asked himself
how he had ever been a moment at his ease those
November evenings in the tavern&rsquo;s back-parlor at
Vermilionville. It was because he had a task there;
sociality was not the business of the hour.</p>

<p>And now I have something else to confess about
Claude; something mortifying in the extreme. For
you see the poverty of all these explanations. Their
very multitude makes them weak. &ldquo;Many fires cannot
quench love;&rdquo; what was the real matter? I will
tell.</p>

<p>Claude&rsquo;s love was a deep sentiment. He had never
allowed it to assert itself as a passion. The most he
would allow it to be was a yearning. It was scarcely
personal. While he was with Marguerite, in the inn,
his diffidence alone was enough to hide from him the
impression she was making on his heart. In all their
intercourse he had scarcely twice looked her full in
the face. Afterward she had simply become in memory
the exponent of an ideal. He found himself often,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
now, asking himself, why are my eyes always looking
for her? Should I actually know her, were I to see
her on this sidewalk, or in this street-car? And while
still asking himself these silent questions, what does
he do one day but fall&mdash;to all intents and purposes,
at least&mdash;fall in love&mdash;pell-mell&mdash;up to the eyebrows&mdash;with
another girl!</p>

<p>Do you remember Uncle Remus&rsquo;s story of Brer
Rabbit with the bucket of honey inverted on him?
It was the same way with Claude. &ldquo;He wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t des
only bedobble wid it, he wuz des kiver&rsquo;d.&rdquo; It happened
thus: An artist friend, whose studio was in
Carondelet Street just off of Canal, had rented to him
for a workroom a little loft above the studio. It had
one window looking out over roofs and chimney-pots
upon the western sky, and another down into the
studio itself. It is right to say friend, although there
was no acquaintanceship until it grew out of this
arrangement. The artist, a single man, was much
Claude&rsquo;s senior; but Claude&rsquo;s taste for design, and
love of work, and the artist&rsquo;s grave sincerity, simplicity,
and cordiality of character&mdash;he was a Spaniard,
with a Spaniard&rsquo;s perfect courtesy&mdash;made a mutual
regard, which only a common diffidence prevented from
running into comradeship.</p>

<p>One Saturday afternoon Claude, thirsting for outdoor
air, left his eyrie for a short turn in Canal Street. The
matin&eacute;e audiences were just out, and the wide balcony-shaded
sidewalks were crowded with young faces
and bright attires. Claude was crossing the &ldquo;neutral
ground&rdquo; toward Bourbon Street, when he saw coming
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
out of Bourbon Street a young man, who might be a
Creole, and two young girls in light, and what seemed
to him extremely beautiful dresses; especially that of
the farther one, who, as the three turned with buoyant
step into Canal Street to their left, showed for an
instant the profile of her face, and then only her back.
Claude&rsquo;s heart beat consciously, and he hurried to
lessen the distance between them. He had seen no
more than the profile, but for the moment in which
he saw it, it seemed to be none other than the face of
Marguerite!</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<h3><a name="PART_III_CHAP_XIII" id="PART_III_CHAP_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII.</h3>

<h3>THE CHASE.</h3>


<p>Claude came on close behind. No; now he could
see his mistake, it was not she. But he could not
regret it. This was Marguerite repeated, yet transcended.
The stature was just perceptibly superior.
The breadth and grace of these shoulders were better
than Marguerite&rsquo;s. The hair, arranged differently and
far more effectively than he had ever seen it on Marguerite&rsquo;s
head, seemed even more luxurious than hers.
There was altogether a finer dignity in this one&rsquo;s carriage
than in that of the little maid of the inn. And
see, now,&mdash;now!&mdash;as she turns her head to glance
into this shop window! It is, and it isn&rsquo;t, it isn&rsquo;t,
and it is, and&mdash;no, no, it is not Marguerite! It is
like her in profile, singularly like, yet far beyond her;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
the nose a little too fine, and a certain sad firmness
about the mouth and eyes, as well as he could see in
the profile, but profiles are so deceptive&mdash;that he had
never seen in Marguerite.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how do I know? What do I know?&rdquo; he
asked himself, still following on. &ldquo;The Marguerite
I know is but a thing of my dreams, and this is not
that Marguerite of my actual sight, to whom I never
gave a word or smile or glance that calls for redemption.
This is the Marguerite of my dreams.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Claude was still following, when without any cause
that one could see, the young man of the group looked
back. He had an unpleasant face; it showed a small
offensive energy that seemed to assert simply him and
all his against you and all yours. His eyes were black,
piercing, and hostile. They darted their glances straight
into Claude&rsquo;s. Guilty Claude! dogging the steps of
ladies on the street! He blushed for shame, turned a
corner into Exchange Alley, walked a little way down
it, came back, saw the great crowd coming and going,
vehicles of all sorts hurrying here and there; ranks of
street-cars waiting their turns to start to all points
of the compass; sellers of peanuts and walking-sticks,
buyers of bouquets, acquaintances meeting or overtaking
one another, nodding bonnets, lifted hats, faces,
faces, faces; but the one face was gone.</p>

<p>Caught, Claude? And by a mere face? The charge
is too unkind. Young folly, yes, or old folly, may
read goodness rashly into all beauty, or not care to
read it in any. But it need not be so. Upon the face
of youth the soul within writes its confessions and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
promises; and when the warm pulses of young nature
are sanctified by upward yearnings, and a pure conscience,
the soul that seeks its mate will seek that face
which, behind and through all excellencies of mere tint
and feature, mirrors back the seeker&rsquo;s own faiths and
hopes; and when that is found, that to such a one is
beauty. Judge not; you never saw this face, fairer than
Marguerite&rsquo;s, to say whether its beauty was mere face,
or the transparent shrine of an equal nobility within.</p>

<p>Besides, Claude would have fired up and denied the
first word of the charge with unpleasant flatness. To
be caught means to be in love, to be in love implies a
wish and hope to marry, and these were just what
Claude could not allow. May not a man, nevertheless,
have an ideal of truth and beauty and look worshipfully
upon its embodiment? Humph!</p>

<p>His eyes sought her in vain not only on that afternoon,
but on many following. The sun was setting
every day later and later through the black lace-work
of pecan-trees and behind low dark curtains of orange
groves, yet he began to be more and more tardy each
succeeding day in meeting his father under the riverside
oaks of the Exposition grounds. And then, on the
seventh day, he saw her again.</p>

<p>Now he was more confident than ever that this vision
and he, except in dreams, had never spoken to each
other. Yet the likeness was wonderful. But so, too,
was the unlikeness. True, this time, she only flashed
across his sight&mdash;out of a bank, into a carriage where
a very &ldquo;American&rdquo;-looking lady sat waiting for her
and was gone. But the bank; the carriage; that lady;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
those earlier companions,&mdash;no, this could not be Marguerite.
Marguerite would have been with her mother.
Now, if one could see Madame Beausoleil&rsquo;s daughter
with Madame Beausoleil at her side to identify her and
distinguish her from this flashing and vanishing apparition
it would clear away a trying perplexity. Why
not be bold and call upon them where they were dwelling?
But where? Their names were not in the directory.
Now, inventive talent, do your best.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said St. Pierre after a long silence.
Claude and he were out on the swollen Mississippi
pulling with steady leisure for the home-side shore,
their skiff pointed half to and half from the boiling
current. The sun was gone; a purple dusk wrapped
either low bank; a steamboat that had passed up
stream was now, at the turning of the bend, only a
cluster of soft red lights; Venus began to make a faint
silvery pathway across the waters. St. Pierre had
the forward seat, at Claude&rsquo;s back. The father looked
with fond perplexity at the strong young shoulders
swinging silently with his own, forward and backward
in slow, monotonous strokes, and said again:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well? Whass matter? Look like cat got yo&rsquo;
tongue. Makin&rsquo; new mash-in?&rdquo; Then in a low dissatisfied
tone&mdash;&ldquo;I reckon somet&rsquo;in&rsquo; mighty curious.&rdquo;
He repeated the last three words in the Acadian
speech: &ldquo;Tcheuque-chose bien tchurieux.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yass,&rdquo; replied the son, &ldquo;mighty strange. I tell
you when we come at home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He told all. Recounted all his heart&rsquo;s longings, all
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
his dreams, every least pang of self-reproach, the
idealization of Marguerite, and the finding of that
ideal incarnated in one who was and yet seemed not
to be, or rather seemed to be and yet was not, Marguerite.
And then he went on to re-assure his father
that this could never mean marriage, never mean the
father&rsquo;s supplanting. A man could worship what he
could never hope to possess. He would rather worship
this than win such kind as he would dare woo.</p>

<p>He said all these things in a very quiet way, with
now and then a silent pause, and now and then a
calm, self-contained tone in resuming; yet his sentences
were often disconnected, and often were half
soliloquy. Such were the only betrayals of emotion
on either side until Claude began to treat&mdash;in the
words just given&mdash;his father&rsquo;s own heart interests;
then the father&rsquo;s eyes stood brimming full. But St.
Pierre did not speak. From the first he had listened
in silence and he offered no interruption until at length
Claude came to that part about the object of his
regard being so far, so utterly, beyond his reach.
Then&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop! Dass all foolishness! You want her?
You kin have her!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, papa! you dawn&rsquo;t awnstand! What I am?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, bah! What anybody is? What she is? She
invanted bigger mash-in dan you? a mo&rsquo; better corn-stubbl&rsquo;
destroyer and plant-corner?&rdquo; He meant corn-planter.
&ldquo;She invant a more handier doubl&rsquo;-action
pea-vine rake? What she done mak&rsquo; her so gran&rsquo;?
Naw, sir! She look fine in de face, yass; and dass
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
all you know. Well, dass all right; dass de &rsquo;Cajun
way&mdash;pick &rsquo;em out by face. You begin &rsquo;Cajun way,
for why you dawn&rsquo;t finish &rsquo;Cajun way? All you got
do, you git good saddle-hoss and ride. Bom-bye you
see her, you ride behind her till you find where her
daddy livin&rsquo; at. Den you ride pas&rsquo; yondah every day
till fo&rsquo;, five days, and den you see de ole man come
scrape friend wid you. Den he hass you drop round,
and fus&rsquo; t&rsquo;ing you know&mdash;<i>adjieu la cal&eacute;ge!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Claude did not dispute the point, though he hardly
thought this case could be worked that way. He
returned in silent thought to the question, how to find
Madame Beausoleil. He tried the mail; no response.
He thought of advertising; but that would never do.
Imagine, &ldquo;If Madame Beausoleil, late of Vermilionville,
will leave her address at this office, she will hear
of something not in the least to her advantage.&rdquo; He
couldn&rsquo;t advertise.</p>

<p>It was midday following the eve of his confession
to his father. For the last eleven or twelve days, ever
since he had seen that blessed apparition turn with
the two young friends into Canal Street out of Bourbon&mdash;he
had been venturing daily, for luncheon, just
down into Bourbon Street, to the Christian Women&rsquo;s
Exchange. Now, by all the laws of fortune he should
in that time have seen in there at least once or twice
a day already, the face he was ever looking for. But
he had not; nor did he to-day. He only saw, or
thought he saw, the cashier&mdash;I should say the cashieress&mdash;glance
crosswise at him with eyes that seemed
to him to say:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
&ldquo;Fool; sneak; whelp; &rsquo;Cajun; our private detectives
are watching you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Both rooms and the veranda were full of ladies and
gentlemen whose faces he dared not lift his eyes to
look into. And yet even in that frame there suddenly
came to him one of those happy thoughts that are supposed
to be the inspirations of inventive genius. A
pleasant little female voice near him said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;And apartments up-stairs that they rent to ladies
only!&rdquo; And instantly the thought came that Marguerite
and her mother might be living there. One
more lump of bread, a final gulp of coffee, a short
search for the waiter&rsquo;s check, and he stands at the
cashieress&rsquo;s desk. She makes change without looking
at him or ceasing to tell a small hunchbacked spinster
standing by about somebody&rsquo;s wedding. But suddenly
she starts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! wasn&rsquo;t that right? You gave me four bits,
didn&rsquo;t you? And I gave you back two bits and a
picayune, and&mdash;sir? Does Madame who? Oh! yes.
I didn&rsquo;t understand you; I&rsquo;m a little deaf on this side;
scarlet fever when I was a little girl. I&rsquo;m not the
regular cashier, she&rsquo;s gone to attend the wedding of
a lady friend. Just wait a moment, please, while I
make change for these ladies. Oh, dear! ma&rsquo;am, is
that the smallest you&rsquo;ve got? I don&rsquo;t believe I can
change that, ma&rsquo;am. Yes&mdash;no&mdash;stop! yes, I can!
no, I can&rsquo;t! let&rsquo;s see! yes, yes, yes, I can; I&rsquo;ve got
it; yes, there! I didn&rsquo;t think I had it.&rdquo; She turned
again to Claude with sisterly confidence. &ldquo;Excuse
me for keeping you waiting; haven&rsquo;t I met you at the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
Y. M. C. A. sociable? Well, you must excuse me,
but I was sure I had. Of course I didn&rsquo;t if you was
never there; but you know in a big city like this you&rsquo;re
always meeting somebody that&rsquo;s ne-e-early somebody
else that you know&mdash;oh! didn&rsquo;t you ask me&mdash;oh,
yes! Madame Beausoleil! Yes, she lives here, she
and her daughter. But she&rsquo;s not in. Oh! I&rsquo;m sorry.
Neither of them is here. She&rsquo;s not in the city;
hasn&rsquo;t been for two weeks. They&rsquo;re coming back;
we&rsquo;re expecting them every day. She heard of the
death of a relative down in Terrebonne somewhere.
I wish they <em>would</em> come back; we miss them here; I
judge they&rsquo;re relatives of yours, if I don&rsquo;t mistake the
resemblance; you seem to take after the daughter;
wait a minute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some one coming up to pay looked at Claude to
see what the daughter was like, and the young man
slipped away, outblushing the night sky when the
marshes are afire.</p>

<p>The question was settled; settled the wrong way.
He hurried on across Canal Street. Marguerite had
not been, as he had construed the inaccurate statement,
in the city for two weeks. Resemblances need
delude him no longer. He went on into Carondelet
Street and was drawing near the door and stairway
leading to his friend&rsquo;s studio and his own little workroom
above it, when suddenly from that very stairway and
door issued she whom, alas! he might now no longer
mistake for Marguerite, yet who, none the less
for lessening hope, held him captive.</p>

<h3><a name="PART_III_CHAP_XIV" id="PART_III_CHAP_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV.</h3>

<h3>WHO SHE WAS.</h3>


<p>For a moment somewhat more than her profile shone
upon Claude&rsquo;s bewildered gaze.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall see her eye to eye at last!&rdquo; shouted his
heart within: but the next moment she turned away,
and with two companions who came across the same
threshold, moved up the street, and, at the nearest
corner, vanished. Her companions were the American
lady and the artist. Claude wheeled, and hurried
to pass around the square in the opposite direction,
and, as he reached the middle of its third side, saw
the artist hand them into the street-car, lift his hat, and
return towards the studio. The two men met at the
foot of the stairs. The Spaniard&rsquo;s countenance betrayed
a restrained elation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You goin&rsquo; see a picture now,&rdquo; he said, in a modestly
triumphant tone. &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; he added, as
Claude would have passed the studio door.</p>

<p>They went in together. The Spaniard talked; Claude
scarcely spoke. I cannot repeat the conversation literally,
but the facts are these: A few evenings before,
the artist had been one of the guests at a musical party
given by a lady whose name he did not mention. He
happened&mdash;he modestly believed it accidental&mdash;to be
seated beside the hostess, when a young lady&mdash;&ldquo;jung
Creole la-thy,&rdquo; he called her&mdash;who was spending a few
days with her, played the violin. The Spaniard&rsquo;s delicate
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
propriety left her also nameless; but he explained
that, as he understood, she was from the Teche. She
played charmingly&mdash;&ldquo;for an amateur,&rdquo; he qualified:
but what had struck him more than the music was her
beauty, her figure, her picturesque grace. And when
he confessed his delight in these, his hostess, seemingly
on the inspiration of the moment, said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Paint her picture! Paint her just so! I&rsquo;ll give
you the order. Not a mere portrait&mdash;a picture.&rdquo;
And he had agreed, and the &ldquo;jung&rdquo; lady had consented.
The two had but just now left the studio.
To-morrow a servant would bring violin, music-rack,
etc.; the ladies would follow, and then&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You hear music, anyhow,&rdquo; said the artist. That
was his gentle way of intimating that Claude was not
invited to be a looker-on.</p>

<p>On the next day, Claude, in his nook above, with
the studio below shut from view by the curtain of his
inner window, heard the ladies come. He knows they
are these two, for one voice, the elder, blooms out at
once in a gay abundance of words, and the other speaks
in soft, low tones that, before they reach his ear, run
indistinguishably together.</p>

<p>Soon there comes the sound of tuning the violin,
while the older voice is still heard praising one thing
and another, and asking careless questions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose that cotton cloth covers something that
is to have a public unveiling some day, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Claude cannot hear the answer; the painter drops
his voice even below its usual quiet tone. But Claude
knows what he must be saying; that the cloth covers
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
merely a portrait he is finishing of a young man who
has sat for it to please a wifeless, and, but for him,
childless, and fondly devoted father. And now he can
tell by the masculine step, and the lady&rsquo;s one or two
lively words, that the artist has drawn away the covering
from his (Claude&rsquo;s) own portrait. But the lady&rsquo;s
young companion goes on tuning her instrument&mdash;&ldquo;tink,
tink, tink;&rdquo; and now the bow is drawn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, how singular!&rdquo; exclaims the elder lady.
&ldquo;Why, my dear, come here and see! Somebody has
got your eyes! Why, he&rsquo;s got your whole state of
mind, a reduplication of it. And&mdash;I declare, he looks
almost as good as you do! If&mdash;I&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>The voice stops short. There is a moment&rsquo;s silence
in which the unseen hearer doubts not the artist is making
signs that yonder window and curtain are all that
hide the picture&rsquo;s original, and the voice says again,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d paint my picture,&rdquo; and the violin
sounds once more its experimental notes.</p>

<p>But there are other things which Claude can neither
hear, nor see, nor guess. He cannot see that the elder
lady is already wondering at, and guardedly watching,
an agitation betrayed by the younger in a tremor of
the hand that fumbles with her music-sheets and music-stand,
in the foot that trembles on the floor, in the reddened
cheek, and in the bitten lip. He may guess that
the painter sits at his easel with kindling eye; but he
cannot guess that just as the elder lady is about to
say,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear, if you don&rsquo;t feel&rdquo;&mdash;the tremor vanishes,
the lips gently set, and only the color remains. But
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
he hears the first soft moan of the tense string under
the bow, and a second, and another; and then, as he
rests his elbows upon the table before him, and covers
his face in his trembling hands, it seems to him as if
his own lost heart had entered into that vibrant medium,
and is pouring thence to heaven and her ear its prayer
of love.</p>

<p>Paint, artist, paint! Let your brushes fly! None
can promise you she shall ever look quite like this
again. Catch the lines,&mdash;the waving masses and dark
coils of that loose-bound hair; the poise of head and
neck; the eloquent sway of the form; the folds of garments
that no longer hide, but are illumined by, the
plenitude of an inner life and grace; the elastic feet;
the ethereal energy and discipline of arms and shoulders;
the supple wrists; the very fingers quivering on
the strings; the rapt face, and the love-inspired eyes.</p>

<p>Claude, Claude! when every bird in forest and field
knows the call of its mate, can you not guess the meaning
of those strings? Must she open those sealed lips
and call your very name&mdash;she who would rather die
than call it?</p>

<p>He does not understand. Yet, without understanding,
he answers. He rises from his seat; he moves
to the window; he will not tiptoe or peep; he will be
bold and bad. Brazenly he lifts the curtain and looks
down; and one, one only&mdash;not the artist and not the
patroness of art, but that one who would not lift her
eyes to that window for all the world&rsquo;s wealth&mdash;knows
he is standing there, listening and looking down. He
counts himself all unseen, yet presently shame drops
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
the curtain. He turns away, yet stands hearkening.
The music is about to end. The last note trembles on
the air. There is silence. Then someone moves from
a chair, and then the single cry of admiration and
delight from the player&rsquo;s companion is the player&rsquo;s
name,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Marguerite Beausoleil!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hours afterward there sat Claude in the seat where
he had sunk down when he heard that name. The
artist&rsquo;s visitors had made a long stay, but at length
they were gone. And now Claude, too, rose to go
out. His steps were heard below, and presently the
painter&rsquo;s voice called persuadingly up:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;St. Pierre! St. Pierre! Come, see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They stood side by side before the new work.
Claude gazed in silence. At length he said, still gazing:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll buy it when &rsquo;tis finish&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the artist explained again that it was being
painted for Marguerite&rsquo;s friend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For what she want it?&rdquo; demanded Claude.
The Spaniard smiled and intimated that the lady probably
thought he could paint. &ldquo;But at any rate,&rdquo; he
went on to say, &ldquo;she seemed to have a hearty affection
for the girl herself, whom,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;she had described
as being as good as she looked.&rdquo; Claude
turned and went slowly out.</p>

<p>When at sunset he stood under the honey-locust tree
on the levee where he was wont to find his father
waiting for him, he found himself alone. But within
speaking distance he saw St. Pierre&rsquo;s skiff just being
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
drawn ashore by a ragged negro, who presently turned
and came to him, half-lifting the wretched hat that
slouched about his dark brows, and smiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sim like you done fo&rsquo;got me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
you &rsquo;member how I use&rsquo; live at Belle Alliance? Yes,
seh. I&rsquo;s de one what show Bonaventure de road to

yes, seh! dass mo&rsquo; &rsquo;n a week, now, since I been
wuckin&rsquo; fo&rsquo; you papa.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They got into the skiff and pushed off, the negro
alone at the oars.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pow&rsquo;ful strong current on udder side,&rdquo; he said,
pulling quietly up-stream to offset the loss of way he
must make presently in crossing the rapid flood.
&ldquo;Mistoo Claude, I see a gen&rsquo;leman dis day noon what
I ain&rsquo;t see&rsquo; befo&rsquo; since &rsquo;bout six year&rsquo; an&rsquo; mo&rsquo;. I

<h3>CAN THEY CLOSE THE BREAK?</h3>


<p>The towering cypresses of the far, southern swamps
have a great width of base, from which they narrow so
rapidly in the first seven or eight feet of their height,
and thence upward taper so gradually, that it is almost
or quite impossible for an axe-man, standing at their
roots, to chop through the great flare that he finds
abreast of him, and bring the trees down. But when
the swamps are deep in water, the swamper may paddle
up to these trees, whose narrowed waists are now within
the swing of his axe, and standing up in his canoe, by
a marvel of balancing skill, cut and cut, until at length
his watchful, up-glancing eye sees the forest giant bow
his head. Then a shove, a few backward sweeps of
the paddle, and the canoe glides aside, and the great
trunk falls, smiting the smooth surface of the water
with a roar that, miles away, reaches the ear like the
thunder of artillery. The tree falls: but if the woodsman
has not known how to judge and choose wisely
when the inner wood is laid bare under the first big
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
chip that flies, there are many chances that the fallen
tree will instantly sink to the bottom of the water, and
cannot be rafted out. One must know his craft, even
in Louisiana swamps. &ldquo;Knowledge is power.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Zos&eacute;phine and Mr. Tarbox finished out that
Sunday twilight walk, they talked, after leaving the
stile behind, only on business. He told her of having
lately been, with a certain expert, in the swamps of
Barataria, where he had seen some noble cypress
forests tantalizingly near to navigation and market,
but practically a great way off, because the levees of
the great sugar estates on the Mississippi River shut
out all deep overflows. Hence these forests could be
bought for, seemingly, a mere tithe of their value.
Now, he proposed to buy such a stretch of them along
the edge of the shaking prairie north of Lake Cataouach&eacute;
as would show on his part, he said, &ldquo;caution,
but not temerity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He invited her to participate. &ldquo;And why?&rdquo; For
the simple reason that the expert, and engineer, had
dropped the remark that, in his opinion, a certain
levee could not possibly hold out against the high
water of more than two or three more years, and that
when it should break it would spread, from three to
nine feet of water, over hundreds of square miles of
swamp forests, <i>prairies tremblantes</i>, and rice and sugar
fields, and many leagues of railway. Zos&eacute;phine had
consented; and though Mr. Tarbox had soon after
gone upon his commercial travels, he had effected the
purchase by correspondence, little thinking that the
first news he should hear on returning to New Orleans
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
would be that the remotely anticipated &ldquo;break&rdquo; had
just occurred.</p>

<p>And now, could and would the breach be closed, or
must all Barataria soon be turned into, and remain for
months, a navigable yellow sea? This, Claude knew,
was what he must hasten to the crevasse to discover,
and return as promptly to report upon, let his heart-strings
draw as they might towards the studio in Carondelet
Street and the Christian Women&rsquo;s Exchange.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<h3><a name="PART_III_CHAP_XVI" id="PART_III_CHAP_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI.</h3>

<h3>THE OUTLAW AND THE FLOOD.</h3>


<p>What suffering it costs to be a coward! Some
days before the crevasse occurred, he whom we know
as the pot-hunter stood again on the platform of that
same little railway station whence we once saw him
vanish at sight of Bonaventure Deschamps. He had
never ventured there since, until now. But there was
a new station agent.</p>

<p>His Indian squaw was dead. A rattlesnake had
given her its fatal sting, and the outcast, dreading all
men and the coroner not the least, had, silently and
alone, buried her on the prairie.</p>

<p>The train rolled up to the station again as before.
Claude&rsquo;s friend, the surveyor, stepped off with a cigar
in his mouth, to enjoy in the train&rsquo;s momentary stay
the delightful air that came across the open prairie.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
The pot-hunter, who had got rid of his game, ventured
near his former patron. It might be the engineer
could give him work whereby to earn a day&rsquo;s ready
money. He was not disappointed. The engineer told
him to come in a day or two, by the waterways the
pot-hunter knew so well, across the swamps and prairies
to Bayou Terrebonne and the little court-house town
of Houma. And then he added:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard this morning that somebody had been
buying the swamp land all around you out on Lake
Cataouach&eacute;. Is it so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Acadian looked vacant and shook his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;a Madame Beausoleil, or
somebod&mdash;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All aboard!&rdquo; cried the train conductor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The fellow turned pale,&rdquo; said the surveyor, as he
resumed his seat in the smoking-car and the landscape
began again to whirl by.</p>

<p>The pot-hunter stood for a moment, and then slowly,
as if he stole away from some sleeping enemy, left
the place. Alarm went with him like an attendant
ghost. A thousand times that day, in the dark swamp,
on the wide prairie, or under his rush-thatch on the
lake-side, he tortured himself with one question: Why
had she&mdash;Zos&eacute;phine&mdash;reached away out from Carancro
to buy the uncultivable and primeval wilderness
round about his lonely hiding-place? Hour after hour
the inexplicable problem seemed to draw near and
nearer to him, a widening, tightening, dreamlike terror,
that, as it came, silently pointed its finger of death at
him. He was glad enough to leave his cabin next day
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
in his small, swift pirogue&mdash;shot-gun, axe, and rifle
his only companions&mdash;for Terrebonne.</p>

<p>It chanced to be noon of the day following, when he
glided up the sunny Terrebonne towards the parish
seat. The shores of the stream have many beauties,
but the Acadian&rsquo;s eyes were alert to any thing but
them. The deep green, waxen-leaved casino hedges;
the hedges of Cherokee rose, and sometimes of rose
and casino mingled; the fields of corn and sugar-cane;
the quaint, railed, floating bridges lying across the
lazy bayou; the orange-groves of aged, giant trees,
their dark green boughs grown all to a tangle with
well-nigh the density of a hedge, and their venerable
trunks hairy with green-gray lichens; the orange-trees
again in the door-yards, with neat pirogues set upon
racks under their deep shade; the indescribable floods
of sunlight and caverns of shadow; the clear, brown
depths beneath his own canoe; or, at the bottom, the
dark, waving, green-brown tresses of water-weeds,&mdash;these
were naught to him.</p>

<p>But the human presence was much; and once, when
just ahead of him he espied a young, sunbonneted
woman crouching in the pouring sunshine beyond
the sod of the bayou&rsquo;s bank, itself but a few inches
above the level of the stream, on a little pier of one
plank pushed out among the flags and reeds, pounding
her washing with a wooden paddle, he stopped the dip
of his canoe-paddle, and gazed with growing trepidation
and slackening speed. At the outer end of the
plank, the habitual dip of the bucket had driven aside
the water-lilies, and made a round, glassy space that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
reflected all but perfectly to him her busy, young,
downcast visage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How like&rdquo;&mdash;Just then she lifted her head. He
started as though his boat had struck a snag. How
like&mdash;how terribly like to that young Zos&eacute;phine whose
ill-concealed scorn he had so often felt in days&mdash;in
years&mdash;long gone, at Carancro! This was not, and
could not be, the same&mdash;lacked half the necessary
years; and yet, in the joy of his relief, he answered
her bow with a question, &ldquo;Whose was yonder house?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She replied in the same Acadian French in which
she was questioned, that there dwelt, or had dwelt,
and about two weeks ago had died, &ldquo;Monsieur Robichaux.&rdquo;
The pot-hunter&rsquo;s paddle dipped again, his
canoe shot on, and two hours later he walked with
dust-covered feet into Houma.</p>

<p>The principal tavern there stands on that corner of
the court-house square to which the swamper would
naturally come first. Here he was to find the engineer.
But, as with slow, diffident step he set one foot upon
the corner of the threshold, there passed quickly by
him and out towards the court-house, two persons,&mdash;one
a man of a county court-room look and with a
handful of documents, and the other a woman whom
he knew at a glance. Her skirts swept his ankles as
he shrank in sudden and abject terror against the wall,
yet she did not see him.</p>

<p>He turned and retreated the way he had come, nothing
doubting that only by the virtue of a voodoo charm
which he carried in his pocket he had escaped, for the
time being, a plot laid for his capture. For the small,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
neatly-robed form that you may still see disappearing
within the court-house door beside the limping figure
of the probate clerk is Zos&eacute;phine Beausoleil. She will
finish the last pressing matter of the Robichaux succession
now in an hour or so, and be off on the little
branch railway, whose terminus is here, for New
Orleans.</p>

<p>When the pot-hunter approached Lake Cataouach&eacute;
again, he made on foot, under cover of rushes and
reeds taller than he, a wide circuit and reconnoissance
of his hut. While still a long way off, he saw, lighted by
the sunset rays, what he quickly recognized as a canoe
drawn half out of the water almost at his door. He
warily drew nearer. Presently he stopped, and stood
slowly and softly shifting his footing about on the oozy
soil, at a little point of shore only some fifty yards
away from his cabin. His eyes, peering from the
ambush, descried a man standing by the pirogue and
searching with his gaze the wide distances that would
soon be hidden in the abrupt fall of the southern night.</p>

<p>The pot-hunter knew him. Not by name, but by
face. The day the outlaw saw Bonaventure at the
little railway station this man was with him. The
name the pot-hunter did not know was St. Pierre.</p>

<p>The ambushed man shrank a step backward into his
hiding-place. His rifle was in his hand and he noiselessly
cocked it. He had not resolved to shoot; but
a rifle is of no use until it is cocked. While he so
stood, another man came into view and to the first
one&rsquo;s side. This one, too, he knew, despite the soft
hat that had taken the place of the silk one; for this
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
was Tarbox. The Acadian was confirmed in his conviction
that the surveyor&rsquo;s invitation for him to come
to Houma was part of a plot to entrap him.</p>

<p>While he still looked the two men got into the canoe
and St. Pierre paddled swiftly away. The pot-hunter
let down the hammer of his gun, shrank away again,
turned and hurried through the tangle, regained his
canoe, and paddled off. The men&rsquo;s departure from
the cabin was, in his belief, a ruse. But he knew how
by circuits and short cuts to follow after them unseen,
and this he did until he became convinced that they
were fairly in the Company Canal and gliding up its
dark colonnade in the direction whence they had evidently
come. Then he returned to his cabin and with
rifle cocked and with slow, stealthy step entered it,
and in headlong haste began to prepare to leave it for
a long hiding-out.</p>

<p>He knew every spot of land and water for leagues
around, as a bear or a fox would know the region
about his den. He had in mind now a bit of dry
ground scarce fifty feet long or wide, deeply hidden
in the swamp to the north of this lake. How it had
ever happened that this dry spot, lifted two or three
feet above the low level around it, had been made,
whether by some dumb force of nature or by the hand
of men yet more untamable than he, had never crossed
his thought. It was beyond measure of more value
to him to know, by what he had seen growing on it
season after season, that for many a long year no
waters had overflowed it. In the lake, close to his
hut, lay moored his small centerboard lugger, and into
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
this he presently threw his few appliances and supplies,
spread sail, and skimmed away, with his pirogue
towing after.</p>

<p>His loaded rifle lay within instant reach. By choice
he would not have harmed any living creature that
men call it wrong to injure; but to save himself, not
only from death, but from any risk of death, rightful
or wrongful, he would, not through courage, but in
the desperation of frantic cowardice, have killed a
hundred men, one by one.</p>

<p>By this time it was night; and when first the lugger
and, after it was hidden away, the pirogue, had carried
him up a slender bayou as near as they could to the
point he wished to reach, he had still to drag the
loaded pirogue no small distance through the dark,
often wet and almost impenetrable woods. He had
taken little rest and less sleep in his late journeyings,
and when at length he cast himself down before his fire
of dead fagots on the raised spot he had chosen, he
slept heavily. He felt safe from man&rsquo;s world, at least
for the night.</p>

<p>Only one thing gave him concern as he lay down.
It was the fact that when, with the old woods-habit
strong on him, he had approached his selected camping
ground, with such wariness of movement as the
dragging pirogue would allow, he had got quite in sight
of it before a number of deer on it bounded away. He
felt an unpleasant wonder to know what their unwilling
boldness might signify.</p>

<p>He did not awake to replenish his fire until there
were only a few live embers shining dimly at his feet.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
He rose to a sitting posture; and in that same moment
there came a confusion of sound&mdash;a trampling through
bushes&mdash;that froze his blood, and robbed his open
throat of power to cry. The next instant he knew it
was but those same deer. But the first intelligent
thought brought a new fear. These most timid of
creatures had made but a few leaps and stopped. He
knew what that meant! As he leaped to his feet the
deer started again, and he heard, to his horror,&mdash;where
the ground had been dry and caked when he lay
down,&mdash;the plash of their feet in water.</p>

<p>Trembling, he drew his boots on, made and lighted
a torch, and in a moment was dragging his canoe after
him in the direction of the lugger. Presently his steps,
too, were plashing. He stooped, waved the torch low
across the water&rsquo;s surface, and followed the gleam
with his scrutiny. But he did so not for any doubt
that he would see, as he did, the yellow flood of the
Mississippi. He believed, as he believed his existence,
that his pursuers had let the river in upon the swamp,
ruin whom they might, to drive him from cover.</p>

<p>Presently he stepped into the canoe, cast his torch
into the water, took his paddle, and glided unerringly
through a darkness and a wild tangle of undergrowth,
large and small, where you or I could not have gone
ten yards without being lost. He emerged successfully
from the forest into the open prairie, and, under
a sky whose stars told him it would soon be day,
glided on down the little bayou lane, between walls of
lofty rushes, up which he had come in the evening,
and presently found the lugger as he had left her,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
with her light mast down, hidden among the brake
canes that masked a little cove.</p>

<p>The waters were already in the prairie. As he
boarded the little vessel at the stern, a raccoon waddled
in noiseless haste over the bow, and splashed into
the wet covert of reeds beyond. If only to keep from
sharing his quarters with all the refuge-hunting vermin
of the noisome wilderness, the one human must move
on. He turned the lugger&rsquo;s prow towards the lake,
and spread her sails to the faint, cool breeze. But
when day broke, the sail was gone.</p>

<p>Far and wide lay the pale green leagues of reeds
and bulrushes, with only here and there a low willow
or two beside some unseen lagoon, or a sinuous band
of darker green, where round rushes and myrtle bushes
followed the shore of some hidden bayou. The waters
of the lake were gleaming and crinkling in tints of
lilac and silver stolen from the air; and away to the
right, and yet farther to the left, stood the dark
phalanxes of cypress woods.</p>

<p>Thus had a thousand mornings risen on the scene in
the sight of the outlaw. Numberless birds fluttered
from place to place, snatching their prey, carolling,
feeding their young, chattering, croaking, warbling,
and swinging on the bending rush. But if you looked
again, strange signs of nature&rsquo;s mute anguish began
to show. On every log or bit of smaller drift that
rain-swollen bayous had ever brought from the forest
and thrown upon their banks some wild tenant of the
jungle, hare or weasel, cat, otter, or raccoon, had taken
refuge, sometimes alone, but oftener sharing it, in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
common misery and silent truce, with deadly foes. For
under all that expanse of green beauty, the water,
always abundant, was no longer here and there, but
everywhere.</p>

<p>See yonder reed but a few yards away. What singular
dark enlargement of stem is that near its top,
that curious spiral growth?&mdash;growth! It is a great
serpent that has climbed and twined himself there,
and is holding on for the life he loves as we love
ours. And see! On a reed near by him, another;
and a little farther off, another; and another&mdash;and
another! Where were our eyes until now? The surface
of the vast brake, as far as one can see such small
things, is dotted with like horrid burdens. And somewhere
in this wild desolation, in this green prospect of
a million deaths waiting in silence alike for harmful
and harmless creatures, one man is hiding from all
mankind.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<h3>WELL HIDDEN.</h3>


<p>Of all the teeming multitudes of the human world,
the pot-hunter knows not one soul who is on his side;
not one whom he dare let see his face or come between
him and a hiding-place. The water is rising fast. He
dare not guess how high it will come; but rise as it
may, linger at its height as it may, he will not be
driven out. In his belief a hundred men are ready, at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
every possible point where his foot could overstep the
line of this vast inundation, to seize him and drag him
to the gallows. Ah, the gallows! Not being dead&mdash;not
God&rsquo;s anger&mdash;not eternal burnings; but simply
facing death! The gallows! The tree above his head&mdash;the
rope around his neck&mdash;the signal about to be
spoken&mdash;the one wild moment after it! These keep
him here.</p>

<p>He has taken down sail and mast. The rushes are
twelve feet high. They hide him well. With oars,
mast, and the like, he has contrived something by
which he can look out over their tops. He has powder
and shot, coffee, salt, and rice; he will not be driven
out! At night he spreads his sail and seeks the open
waters of the lake, where he can sleep, by littles, without
being overrun by serpents; but when day breaks,
there is no visible sign of his presence. Yet he is
where he can see his cabin. It is now deep in the
water, and the flood is still rising. He is quite sure
no one has entered it since he left it. But&mdash;the strain
of perpetual watching!</p>

<p>When at dawn of the fifth day he again looked for
cover in the prairie, the water was too high to allow
him concealment, and he sought the screen of some
willows that fringed the edge of the swamp forest,
anchoring in a few rods&rsquo; width of open water between
them and the woods. He did not fear to make, on
the small hearth of mud and ashes he had improvised
in his lugger, the meagre fire needed to prepare his
food. Its slender smoke quickly mingled with the
hazy vapors and shadows of the swamp. As he cast
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
his eye abroad, he found nowhere any sign of human
approach. Here and there the tops of the round rushes
still stood three feet above the water, but their slender
needles were scarcely noticeable. Far and near, over
prairie as over lake, lay the unbroken yellow flood.
There was no flutter of wings, no whistle of feathered
mate to mate, no call of nestlings from the ruined
nests. Except the hawk and vulture, the birds were
gone. Untold thousands of dumb creatures had clung
to life for a time, but now were devoured by birds of
prey and by alligators, or were drowned. Thousands
still lived on. Behind him in the swamp the wood-birds
remained, the gray squirrel still barked and
leaped from tree to tree, the raccoon came down to
fish, the plundering owl still hid himself through the
bright hours, and the chilled snake curled close in the
warm folds of the hanging moss. Nine feet of water
below. In earlier days, to the northward through the
forest, many old timbers rejected in railway construction
or repair, with dead logs and limbs, had been
drifted together by heavy rains, and had gathered a
covering of soil; canebrake, luxurious willow-bushes,
and tough grasses had sprung up on them and bound
them with their roots. These floating islands the flood,
now covering the dense underbrush of the swamp, lifted
on its free surface, and, in its slow creep southward,
bore through the pillared arcades of the cypress wood
and out over the submerged prairies. Many a cowering
deer in those last few days that had made some
one of these green fragments of the drowned land a
haven of despair, the human castaway left unharmed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
Of all sentient creatures in that deluge he was
suffering most. He was gaunt and haggard with
watching. The thought of pursuit bursting suddenly
around him now fastened permanently upon his imagination.
He feared to sleep. From the direction of
the open water surprise seemed impossible; but from
the forest! what instant might it not ring with the
whoop of discovery, the many-voiced halting challenge,
and the glint of loaded Winchester? And another
fear had come. Many a man not a coward, and as
used to the sight of serpents as this man, has never
been able to be other than a coward concerning them.
The pot-hunter held them in terror. It was from fear
of them that he had lighted his torch the night of his
bivouac in the swamp. Only a knowledge of their
ordinary haunts and habits and the art of avoiding
them had made the swamp and prairie life bearable.
Now all was changed. They were driven from their
dens. In the forest one dared not stretch forth the
hand to lay it upon any tangible thing until a searching
glance had failed to find the glittering eye and forked
tongue that meant &ldquo;Beware!&rdquo; In the flooded prairie
the willow-trees were loaded with the knotted folds of
the moccasin, the rattlesnake, and I know not how
many other sorts of deadly or only loathsome serpents.
Some little creatures at the bottom of the water, feeding
on the soft white part of the round rush near its
root, every now and then cut a stem free from its base,
and let it spring to the surface and float away. Often
a snake had wrapped himself about the end above the
water, and when this refuge gave way and drifted
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
abroad he would cling for a time, until some less forlorn
hope came in sight, and then swim for it. Thus
scarce a minute of the day passed, it seemed, but one,
two, or three of these creatures, making for their fellow-castaway&rsquo;s
boat, were turned away by nervous
waving of arms. The nights had proved that they
could not climb the lugger&rsquo;s side, and when he was
in her the canoe was laid athwart her gunwales; but at
night he had to drop the bit of old iron that served
for an anchor, and the very first night a large moccasin&mdash;not
of the dusky kind described in books, but of
that yet deadlier black sort, an ell in length, which the
swampers call the Congo&mdash;came up the anchor-rope.
The castaway killed it with an oar; but after that
who would have slept?</p>

<p>About sunset of the fifth day, though it was bright
and beautiful, the hunter&rsquo;s cunning detected the first
subtle signs of a coming storm. He looked about him
to see what provision was needed to meet and weather
its onset. On the swamp side the loftiest cypresses,
should the wind bring any of them down, would not
more than cast the spray of their fall as far as his
anchorage. The mass of willows on the prairie side
was nearer, but its trees stood low,&mdash;already here and
there the branches touched the water; the hurricane
might tear away some boughs, but could do no more.
He shortened the anchor-rope, and tried the hold of
the anchor on the bottom to make sure the lugger
might not swing into the willows, for in every fork of
every bough was a huge dark mass of serpents plaited
and piled one upon another, and ready at any moment
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
to glide apart towards any new shelter that might be
reached.</p>

<p>While eye and hand were thus engaged, the hunter&rsquo;s
ear was attentive to sounds that he had been hearing
for more than an hour. These were the puff of &rsquo;scape-pipes
and plash of a paddle-wheel, evidently from a
small steamer in the Company Canal. She was coming
down it; that is, from the direction of the river
and the city.</p>

<p>Whither was she bound? To some one of the hundred
or more plantations and plantation homes that the
far-reaching crevasse had desolated? Likely enough.
In such event she would not come into view, although
for some time now he had seen faint shreds of smoke in
the sky over a distant line of woods. But it filled him
with inward tremors to know that if she chose to leave
the usual haunts of navigation on her left, and steam
out over the submerged prairies and the lake, and into the
very shadow of these cypresses, she could do it without
fear of a snag or a shallow. He watched anxiously as
the faint smoke reached a certain point. If the next
thin curl should rise farther on, it would mean safety.
But when it came it seemed to be in the same place as
the last; and another the same, and yet another the
same: she was making almost a straight line for the
spot where he stood. Only a small low point of forest
broke the line, and presently, far away, she slowly
came out from behind it.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<h3><a name="PART_III_CHAP_XVIII" id="PART_III_CHAP_XVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII.</h3>

<h3>THE TORNADO.</h3>


<p>The Acadian stooped at once and with a quick
splash launched his canoe. A minute later he was in
it, gliding along and just within the edge of the forest
where it swept around nearly at right angles to the
direction in which the steamboat was coming. Thus
he could watch the approaching steamer unseen, while
every moment putting distance between himself and
the lugger.</p>

<p>The strange visitor came on. How many men there
were on her lower deck! Were they really negroes, or
had they blackened their faces, as men sometimes do
when they are going to hang a poor devil in the woods?
On the upper deck are two others whose faces do not
seem to be blackened. But a moment later they are
the most fearful sight of all; for only too plainly does
the fugitive see that they are the same two men who
stood before the doorway of his hut six days before.
And see how many canoes on the lower deck!</p>

<p>While the steamer is yet half a mile away from the
hidden lugger, her lamps and fires and their attendant
images in the water beneath glow softly in the fast
deepening twilight, and the night comes swiftly down.
The air is motionless. Across the silent waste an engine
bell jangles; the puff of steam ceases; the one
plashing paddle-wheel at the stern is still; the lights
glide more and more slowly; with a great crash and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
rumble, that is answered by the echoing woods, the
anchor-chain runs out its short measure, and the
steamer stops.</p>

<p>Gently the pot-hunter&rsquo;s paddle dipped again, and
the pirogue moved back towards the lugger. It may
be that the flood was at last numbing his fear, as it had
so soon done that of all the brute-life around him; it
was in his mind to do something calling for more courage
than he had ever before commanded in his life,
save on that one day in Carancro, when, stung to
madness by the taunts of a brave man, and driven to
the wall, he had grappled and slain his tormentor.
He had the thought now to return, and under cover of
the swamp&rsquo;s deep outer margin of shadow, silently lift
into the canoe the bit of iron that anchored the lugger,
and as noiselessly draw her miles away to another
covert; or if the storm still held back, even at length
to step the mast, spread the sail, and put the horizon
between him and the steamer before daybreak. This
he had now started to do, and would do, if only courage
would hold on and the storm hold off.</p>

<p>For a time his canoe moved swiftly; but as he drew
near the lugger his speed grew less and less, and eye
and ear watched and hearkened with their intensest
might. He could hear talking on the steamer. There
was a dead calm. He had come to a spot just inside
the wood, abreast of the lugger. His canoe slowly
turned and pointed towards her, and then stood still.
He sat there with his paddle in the water, longing like
a dumb brute; longing, and, without a motion, struggling
for courage enough to move forward. It would
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
not come. His heart jarred his frame with its beating.
He could not stir.</p>

<p>As he looked out upon the sky a soft, faint tremor
of light glimmered for a moment over it, without disturbing
a shadow below. The paddle stirred gently,
and the canoe slowly drew back; the storm was coming
to betray him with its lightnings. In the black forest&rsquo;s
edge the pot-hunter lingered trembling. Oh for the
nerve to take a brave man&rsquo;s chances! A little courage
would have saved his life. He wiped the dew
from his brow with his sleeve; every nerve had let go.
Again there came across the water the very words of
those who talked together on the steamer. They were
saying that the felling of trees would begin in the
morning; but they spoke in a tongue which Acadians
of late years had learned to understand, though many
hated it, but of which he had never known twenty
words, and what he had known were now forgotten&mdash;the
English tongue. Even without courage, to have
known a little English would have made the difference
between life and death. Another glimmer spread
dimly across the sky, and a faint murmur of far-off
thunder came to the ear. He turned the pirogue and
fled.</p>

<p>Soon the stars are hidden. A light breeze seems
rather to tremble and hang poised than to blow. The
rolling clouds, the dark wilderness, and the watery
waste shine out every moment in the wide gleam of
lightnings still hidden by the wood, and are wrapped
again in ever-thickening darkness over which thunders
roll and jar, and answer one another across the sky.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
Then, like a charge of ten thousand lancers, come the
wind and the rain, their onset covered by all the artillery
of heaven. The lightnings leap, hiss, and blaze;
the thunders crack and roar; the rain lashes; the
waters writhe; the wind smites and howls. For five,
for ten, for twenty minutes,&mdash;for an hour, for two
hours,&mdash;the sky and the flood are never for an instant
wholly dark, or the thunder for one moment silent;
but while the universal roar sinks and swells, and the
wide, vibrant illumination shows all things in ghostly
half-concealment, fresh floods of lightning every moment
rend the dim curtain and leap forth; the glare
of day falls upon the swaying wood, the reeling, bowing,
tossing willows, the seething waters, the whirling
rain, and in the midst the small form of the distressed
steamer, her revolving paddle-wheels toiling behind to
lighten the strain upon her anchor-chains; then all
are dim ghosts again, while a peal, as if the heavens
were rent, rolls off around the sky, comes back in
shocks and throbs, and sinks in a long roar that before
it can die is swallowed up in the next flash and peal.</p>

<p>The deserted lugger is riding out the tornado.
Whirled one moment this way and another that, now
and again taking in water, her forest-shelter breaks the
force of many a gust that would have destroyed her
out in the open. But in the height of the storm her
poor substitute for an anchor lets go its defective hold
on the rushy bottom and drags, and the little vessel
backs, backs, into the willows. She escapes such entanglement
as would capsize her, and by and by, when
the wind lulls for a moment and then comes with all
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
its wrath from the opposite direction, she swings clear
again and drags back nearly to her first mooring and
lies there, swinging, tossing, and surviving still,&mdash;a
den of snakes.</p>

<p>The tempest was still fierce, though abating, and
the lightning still flashed, but less constantly, when
at a point near the lugger the pirogue came out of the
forest, laboring against the wind and half-filled with
water. On the face of the storm-beaten man in it
each gleam of the lightning showed the pallid confession
of mortal terror. Where that frail shell had been,
or how often it had cast its occupant out, no one can
ever know. He was bareheaded and barefooted.
One cannot swim in boots; without them, even one
who has never dared learn how may hope to swim
a little.</p>

<p>In the darkness he drew alongside the lugger, rose,
balanced skilfully, seized his moment, and stepped
safely across her gunwale. A slight lurch caused him
to throw his arms out to regain his poise; the line by
which he still held the canoe straightened out its length
and slipped from his grasp. In an instant the pirogue
was gone. A glimmer of lightning showed her driving
off sidewise before the wind. But it revealed
another sight also. It was dark again, black; but the
outcast stood freezing with horror and fright, gazing
just in advance of his feet and waiting for the next
gleam. It came, brighter than the last; and scarcely
a step before him he saw three great serpents moving
towards the spot that gave him already such slender
footing. He recoiled a step&mdash;another; but instantly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
as he made the second a cold, living form was under
his foot, its folds flew round his ankle, and once!
twice! it struck! With a frantic effort he spurned it
from him; all in the same instant a blaze of lightning
discovered the maimed form and black and red markings
of a &ldquo;bastard hornsnake,&rdquo; and with one piercing
wail of despair, that was drowned in the shriek of the
wind and roar of the thunder, he fell.</p>

<p>A few hours later the winds were still, the stars
were out, a sweet silence had fallen upon water and
wood, and from her deck the watchmen on the steamer
could see in the north-eastern sky a broad, soft, illumination,
and knew it was the lights of slumbering New
Orleans, eighteen miles away.</p>

<p>By and by, farther to the east, another brightness
began to grow and gather this light into its outstretched
wings. In the nearest wood a soft twitter
came from a single tiny bird. Another voice answered
it. A different note came from a third quarter; there
were three or four replies; the sky turned to blue, and
began to flush; a mocking-bird flew out of the woods
on her earliest quest for family provision; a thrush
began to sing; and in a moment more the whole forest
was one choir.</p>

<p>What wonderful purity was in the fragrant air;
what color was on the calm waters and in the deep
sky; how beautiful, how gentle was Nature after her
transport of passion! Shall we ever subdue her and
make her always submissive and compliant? Who
knows? Who knows what man may do with her when
once he has got self, the universal self, under perfect
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
mastery? See yonder huge bull-alligator swimming
hitherward out of the swamp. Even as you point he
turns again in alarm and is gone. Once he was man&rsquo;s
terror, Leviathan. The very lions of Africa and the
grizzlies of the Rockies, so they tell us, are no longer
the bold enemies of man they once were. &ldquo;Subdue
the earth&rdquo;&mdash;it is being done. Science and art, commerce
and exploration, are but parts of religion.
Help us, brothers all, with every possible discovery
and invention to complete the conquest begun in that
lost garden whence man and woman first came forth,
not for vengeance but for love, to bruise the serpent&rsquo;s
head. But as yet, both within us and without us,
what terrible revolts doth Nature make! what awful
victories doth she have over us, and then turn and
bless and serve us again!</p>

<p>As the sun was rising, one of the timber-cutters
from the steamer stood up in his canoe about half a
mile away, near the wood and beside some willows,
and halloed and beckoned. And when those on the
steamer hearkened he called again, bidding them tell
&ldquo;de boss&rdquo; that he had found a canoe adrift, an anchored
boat, and a white man in her, dead.</p>

<p>Tarbox and St. Pierre came in a skiff.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is he drowned?&rdquo; asked Mr. Tarbox, while still
some distance off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Been struck by lightnin&rsquo; sim like,&rdquo; replied the
negro who had found the body.&mdash;&ldquo;Watch out, Mistoo
Tah-bawx!&rdquo; he added, as the skiff drew near; &ldquo;dat
boat dess lousy wid snake&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tarbox stood up in the skiff and looked sadly upon
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
the dead face. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s our man,&rdquo; he said to St.
Pierre.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dass what I say!&rdquo; exclaimed the negro. &ldquo;Yes,
seh, so soon I see him I say, mos&rsquo; sholy dass de same
man what Mistoo Tah-bawx lookin&rsquo; faw to show him
&rsquo;roun&rsquo; &rsquo;bout de swamp! Yes, seh, not-instandin&rsquo; I
never see him befo&rsquo;! No, seh.&mdash;Lawd! look yondeh!
look dat big bahsta&rsquo;d hawn-snake! He kyant git
away: he&rsquo;s hu&rsquo;t! Lawd! dass what kill dat man!
Dat man trawmp on him in de dark, and he strack him
wid his hawny tail! Look at dem fo&rsquo; li&rsquo;l&rsquo; spot&rsquo; on de
man&rsquo; foot! Now, Mistoo Tah-bawx! You been talk&rsquo;
&rsquo;bout dem ah bahsta&rsquo;d hawn-snake not pizen! Well,
mos&rsquo; sholy dey <em>bite</em> ain&rsquo;t pizen; but if dat hawn on de
een of his tail dess on&rsquo;y tetch you, you&rsquo; gone! Look
at dat man! Kill&rsquo; him so quick dey wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t time for
de place to swell whah he was hit!&rdquo; But Tarbox
quietly pointed out to St. Pierre that the tiny wounds
were made by the reptile&rsquo;s teeth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The coroner&rsquo;s verdict will probably be &lsquo;privation
and exposure,&rsquo;&rdquo; said he softly; &ldquo;but it ought to be,
&lsquo;killed by fright and the bite of a harmless snake.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>On his murmured suggestion, St. Pierre gave orders
that, with one exception, every woodsman go to his
tree-felling, and that the lugger and canoe, with the
dead man lying untouched, be towed by skiff and a
single pair of oars to the head of the canal for inquest
and burial.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go with him,&rdquo; said Tarbox softly to St. Pierre.
&ldquo;We owe him all we&rsquo;re going to get out of these
woods, and I owe him a great deal more.&rdquo; When a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
little later he was left for a moment without a hearer,
he said to the prostrate form, &ldquo;Poor fellow! And to
think I had her message to you to come out of this
swamp and begin to live the life of a live man!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The rude funeral moved away, and soon the woods
were ringing with the blow of axes and the shout and
song of black timber-men as gayly as though there
never had been or was to be a storm or a death.</p>

<h3>&ldquo;TEARS AND SUCH THINGS.&rdquo;</h3>


<p>Marguerite and her friend had no sooner taken
their seats to drive home from the studio the day the
sketch was made than Marguerite began a perfect
prattle. Her eyes still shone exaltedly, and leaped
and fell and darkened and brightened with more than
the swift variety of a fountain in the moonlight, while
she kept trying in vain to meet her companion&rsquo;s looks
with a moment&rsquo;s steady regard.</p>

<p>Claude was found! and she trembled with delight.
But, alas! he had heard her passionate call and yet
stood still; had looked down upon her in silence, and
drawn again the curtain between them. She had
thought until the last moment, &ldquo;He will come; he
will confront us as we pass out the door&mdash;will overtake
us at the foot of the stairs&mdash;on the sidewalk&mdash;at
the carriage window.&rdquo; But it had not been so; and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
now they were gone from the place; and here sat this
friend, this gay, cynical knower of men&rsquo;s and women&rsquo;s
ways, answering her chatter in short, smiling responses,
with a steady eye fixed on her, and reading,
Marguerite believed, as plainly as if it were any of the
sign-boards along the rattling street, the writing on her
fluttering heart. And so, even while she trembled
with strange delight, pain, shame, and alarm pleaded
through her dancing glances, now by turns and now in
confusion together, for mercy and concealment. But
in fact, as this friend sat glancing upon the young face
beside her with secret sympathy and admiration, it
was only this wild fear of betrayal that at length
betrayed.</p>

<p>Reaching the house, the street door was hardly shut
behind them when Marguerite would have darted up
to her chamber; but her friend caught her hands
across the balustrade, and said, with roguery in her
own eyes:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Marguerite, you sweet rowdy&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;W&rsquo;at?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, <em>what</em>. There&rsquo;s something up; what is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl tried to put on surprise; but her eyes failed
her again. She leaned on the rail and looked down,
meanwhile trying softly to draw away up-stairs; but
her friend held on to one hand and murmured:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just one question, dearie, just one. I&rsquo;ll not ask
another: I&rsquo;ll die first. You&rsquo;ll probably find me <i>in
articulo mortis</i> when you come down-stairs. Just one
question, lovie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>W&rsquo;at</em> it is?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing but this; I ask for information.&rdquo; The
voice dropped to a whisper,&mdash;&ldquo;Is he as handsome as
his portrait?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The victim rallied all her poor powers of face, and
turned feebly upon the questioner:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Po&rsquo;trait? Who?&rdquo; Her voice was low, and she
glanced furtively at the nearest door. &ldquo;I dawn&rsquo;t
awnstan you.&rdquo; Her hand pulled softly for its freedom,
and she turned to go, repeating, with averted
face, &ldquo;I dawn&rsquo;t awnstan you &rsquo;t all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, never mind then, dear, if you don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo;
responded the tease, with mock tenderness.
&ldquo;But, <i>ma belle Cr&eacute;ole</i>&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Je suis Acadienne.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re an angel, faintly disguised. Only&mdash;look
around here&mdash;only, Angelica, don&rsquo;t try to practise
woman&rsquo;s humbug on a woman. At least, not on this
old one. It doesn&rsquo;t work. I&rsquo;ll tell you whom I
mean.&rdquo; She pulled, but Marguerite held off. &ldquo;I
mean,&rdquo; she hoarsely whispered,&mdash;&ldquo;I mean the young
inventor that engineer told us about. Remember?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marguerite, with her head bowed low, slowly dragged
her hand free, and moved with growing speed up the
stairs, saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dawn&rsquo;t know what is dat. I dawn&rsquo;t awnstan
you &rsquo;t all.&rdquo; Her last words trembled as if nigh to
tears. At the top of the stairs the searching murmur
of her friend&rsquo;s voice came up, and she turned and
looked back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forgive me!&rdquo; said the figure below. The girl
stood a moment, sending down a re-assuring smile.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
&ldquo;You young rogue!&rdquo; murmured the lady, looking
up with ravished eyes. Then she lifted herself on
tiptoe, made a trumpet of both little hands, and
whispered:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t&mdash;worry! We&rsquo;ll bring it out&mdash;all right!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whereat Marguerite blushed from temple to throat,
and vanished.</p>

<p>The same day word came from her mother of her
return from Terrebonne, and she hastened to rejoin
her in their snug rooms over the Women&rsquo;s Exchange.
When she snatched Zos&eacute;phine into her arms and shed
tears, the mother merely wiped and kissed them away,
and asked no explanation.</p>

<p>The two were soon apart. For Marguerite hungered
unceasingly for solitude. Only in solitude could she,
or dared she, give herself up to the constant recapitulation
of every minutest incident of the morning. And
that was ample employment. They seemed the happenings
of a month ago. She felt as if it were imperative
to fix them in her memory now, or lose them in
confusion and oblivion forever. Over them all again
and again she went, sometimes quickening memory
with half-spoken words, sometimes halting in long
reverie at some intense juncture: now with tingling
pleasure at the unveiling of the portrait, the painter&rsquo;s
cautionary revelation of the personal presence above,
or Claude&rsquo;s appearance at the window; now with
burnings of self-abasement at the passionate but ineffectual
beseechings of her violin; and always ending
with her face in her hands, as though to hide her face
even from herself for shame that with all her calling&mdash;her
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
barefaced, as it seemed to her, her abject calling&mdash;he
had not come.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Marguerite, my child, it is time for bed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She obeyed. It was all one, the bed or the window.
Her mother, weary with travel, fell asleep; but she&mdash;she
heard the clock down-stairs strike, and a clock
next door attest, twelve&mdash;one&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four,
and another day began to shine in at the window. As
it brightened, her spirits rose. She had been lying
long in reverie; now she began once more the oft-repeated
rehearsal. But the new day shone into it
also. When the silent recital again reached its end,
the old distress was no longer there, but in its place
was a new, sweet shame near of kin to joy. The face,
unhidden, looked straight into the growing light.
Whatever else had happened, this remained,&mdash;that
Claude was found. She silently formed the name on
her parted lips&mdash;&ldquo;Claude! Claude! Claude! Claude!&rdquo;
and could not stop though it gave her pain, the pain
was so sweet. She ceased only when there rose before
her again the picture of him drawing the curtain and
disappearing; but even then she remembered the
words, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry; we&rsquo;ll bring it out all right,&rdquo;
and smiled.</p>

<p>When Zos&eacute;phine, as the first sunbeam struck the
window-pane, turned upon her elbow and looked into
the fair face beside her, the eyes were closed in sleep.
She arose, darkened the room, and left it.</p>

<h3><a name="PART_III_CHAP_XX" id="PART_III_CHAP_XX"></a>CHAPTER XX.</h3>

<h3>LOVE, ANGER, AND MISUNDERSTANDING.</h3>


<p>The city bells had sounded for noon when the
sleeper opened her eyes. While she slept, Claude had
arrived again at his father&rsquo;s cottage from the scene
of the crevasse, and reported to Tarbox the decision of
himself and the engineer, that the gap would not be
closed for months to come. While he told it, they sat
down with St. Pierre to breakfast. Claude, who had had
no chance even to seek sleep, ate like a starved horse.
Tarbox watched him closely, with hidden and growing
amusement. Presently their eyes fastened on each
other steadily. Tarbox broke the silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>You</em> don&rsquo;t care how the crevasse turns out. I&rsquo;ve
asked you a question now twice, and you don&rsquo;t even
hear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why you don&rsquo;t ass ag&rsquo;in?&rdquo; responded the younger
man, reaching over to the meat-dish and rubbing his
bread in the last of the gravy. Some small care called
St. Pierre away from the board. Tarbox leaned forward
on his elbows, and, not knowing he quoted, said
softly,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something up. What is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Op?&rdquo; asked Claude, in his full voice, frowning.
&ldquo;Op where?&mdash;w&rsquo;at, <em>w&rsquo;at</em> is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes!&rdquo; said Tarbox, with affected sadness.
&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s it; I thought so.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Oh-hon for somebody, oh hey for somebody.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
Claude stopped with a morsel half-way to his mouth,
glared at him several seconds, and then resumed his
eating; not like a horse now, but like a bad dog gnawing
an old bone. He glanced again angrily at the
embodiment of irreverence opposite. Mr. Tarbox
smiled. Claude let slip, not intending it, an audible
growl, with his eyes in the plate. Mr. Tarbox&rsquo;s smile
increased to a noiseless laugh, and grew and grew until
it took hopeless possession of him. His nerves relaxed,
he trembled, the table trembled with him, his
eyes filled with tears, his brows lifted laboriously, he
covered his lips with one hand, and his abdomen shrank
until it pained him. And Claude knew, and showed
he knew it all; that was what made it impossible to
stop. At length, with tottering knees, Mr. Tarbox
rose and started silently for the door. He knew
Claude&rsquo;s eyes were following. He heard him rise to
his feet. He felt as though he would have given a
thousand dollars if his legs would but last him through
the doorway. But to crown all, St. Pierre met him
just on the threshold, breaking, with unintelligent
sympathy, into a broad, simple smile. Tarbox laid
one hand upon the door for support, and at that moment
there was a hurtling sound; something whizzed
by Tarbox&rsquo;s ear, and the meat-dish crashed against
the door-post, and flew into a hundred pieces.</p>

<p>The book-agent ran like a deer for a hundred yards
and fell grovelling upon the turf, the laugh still griping
him with the energy of a panther&rsquo;s jaws, while Claude,
who, in blind pursuit, had come threshing into his
father&rsquo;s arms, pulled his hat over his eyes and strode
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
away towards the skiff ferry. As Mr. Tarbox returned
towards the cottage, St. Pierre met him, looking
very grave, if not displeased. The swamper spoke
first.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dass mighty good for you I was yondah to stop
dat boy. He would &rsquo;a&rsquo; half-kill&rsquo; you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d have served me ex-actly right,&rdquo; said the
other, and laughed again. St. Pierre shook his head,
as though this confession were poor satisfaction, and
said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dass not safe&mdash;make a &rsquo;Cajun mad. He dawn&rsquo;t
git mad easy, but when he <em>git</em> mad it bre&rsquo;k out all ove&rsquo;
him, yass. He goin&rsquo; feel bad all day now; I see tear&rsquo;
in his eye when he walk off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; said Tarbox sincerely, and presently
added, &ldquo;Now, while you look up a picked gang of
timber-men, I&rsquo;ll see if I can charter a little stern-wheel
steamer, get that written permission from Madame
Beausoleil to cut trees on her land, and so forth, and
so forth. You&rsquo;ll hardly see me before bedtime
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was the first hour of the afternoon when Claude
left his little workroom and walked slowly down to,
and across, Canal Street and into Bourbon. He had
spent the intervening hours seated at his work-table
with his face in his hands. He was in great bitterness.
His late transport of anger gave him no burdensome
concern. Indeed, there was consolation in the thought
that he should, by and by, stand erect before one who
was so largely to blame, and make that full confession
and apology which he believed his old-time Grande
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
Pointe schoolmaster would have offered could Bonaventure
ever have so shamefully forgotten himself.
Yet the chagrin of having at once so violently and so
impotently belittled himself added one sting more to his
fate. He was in despair. An escaped balloon, a burst
bubble, could hardly have seemed more utterly beyond
his reach than now did Marguerite. And he could not
blame her. She was right, he said sternly to himself&mdash;right
to treat his portrait as something that reminded
her of nothing, whether it did so or not; to play on
with undisturbed inspiration; to lift never a glance to
his window; and to go away without a word, a look,
a sign, to any one, when the least breath or motion
would have brought him instantly into her sacred
presence. She was right. She was not for him.
There is a fitness of things, and there was no fitness&mdash;he
said&mdash;of him for her. And yet she must and
would ever be more to him than any one else. He
would glory in going through life unloved, while his
soul lived in and on the phantom companionship of
that vision of delight which she was and should ever
be. The midday bells sounded softly here and there.
He would walk.</p>

<p>As I say, he went slowly down the old rue Bourbon.
He had no hunger; he would pass by the Women&rsquo;s
Exchange. There was nothing to stop there for; was
not Madame Beausoleil in Terrebonne, and Marguerite
the guest of that chattering woman in silk and laces?
But when he reached the Exchange doors he drifted in
as silently and supinely as any drift-log would float
into the new crevasse.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
The same cashier was still on duty. She lighted up
joyously as he entered, and, when he had hung his
hat near the door, leaned forward to address him; but
with a faint pain in his face, and loathing in his heart,
he passed on and out into the veranda. The place was
well filled, and he had to look about to find a seat.
The bare possibility that <em>she</em> might be there was overpowering.
There was a total suspension of every sort
of emotion. He felt, as he took his chair and essayed
to glance casually around, as light and unreal as any
one who ever walked the tight-rope in a dream. The
blood leaped in torrents through his veins, and yet his
movements, as he fumbled aimlessly with his knife,
fork, and glass, were slow and languid.</p>

<p>A slender young waitress came, rested her knuckles
on the table, and leaned on them, let her opposite arm
hang limply along the sidewise curve of her form, and
bending a smile of angelic affection upon the young
Acadian, said in a confidential undertone:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The cashier told me to tell you those ladies have
come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Claude rose quickly and stood looking upon the face
before him, speechless. It was to him exactly as if a
man in uniform had laid a hand upon his shoulder and
said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re my prisoner.&rdquo; Then, still gazing, and
aware of others looking at him, he slowly sank again
into his seat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She just told me to tell you,&rdquo; said the damsel.
&ldquo;Yes, sir. Have you ordered?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Humph?&rdquo; He was still looking at her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, have you given your order?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
&ldquo;Yass.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She paused awkwardly, for she knew he had not,
and saw that he was trying vainly to make her words
mean something in his mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t I get you some coffee and rolls&mdash;same as
day before yesterday?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yass.&rdquo; He did not know what she said. His
heart had stopped beating; now it began again at a
gallop. He turned red. He could see the handkerchief
that was wadded into his outer breast-pocket jar
in time with the heavy thump, thump, thump beneath it.
The waitress staid an awful time. At last she came.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I waited,&rdquo; she sweetly said, &ldquo;to get <em>hot</em> ones.&rdquo;
He drew the refreshments towards him mechanically.
The mere smell of food made him sick. It seemed
impossible that he should eat it. She leaned over him
lovingly and asked, as if referring to the attitude,
&ldquo;Would you like any thing more?&mdash;something sweet?&rdquo;
His flesh crawled. He bent over his plate, shook his
head, and stirred his coffee without having put any thing
into it.</p>

<p>She tripped away, and he drew a breath of momentary
relief, leaned back in his chair, and warily passed
his eyes around to see if there was anybody who was
not looking at him and waiting for him to begin to
eat.</p>

<p>Ages afterward&mdash;to speak with Claude&rsquo;s feelings&mdash;he
rose, took up his check, and went to the desk. The
cashier leaned forward and said with soft blitheness:</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re here. They&rsquo;re up-stairs now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Claude answered never a word. He paid his check.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
As he waited for change, he cast another glance over
the various groups at the tables. All were strangers.
Then he went out. On the single sidewalk step he
halted, and red and blind with mortification, turned
again into the place; he had left his hat. With one
magnificent effort at dignity and unconcern he went to
the rack, took down the hat, and as he lowered it
towards his head cast a last look down the room, and&mdash;there
stood Marguerite. She had entered just in
time, it seemed to him, but just too late, in fact, to see
and understand the blunder. Oh, agony! They bowed
to each other with majestic faintness, and then each
from each was gone. The girl at the desk saw it and
was dumb.</p>

<h3>LOVE AND LUCK BY ELECTRIC LIGHT.</h3>


<p>Mr. Tarbox was really a very brave man. For,
had he not been, how could he have ventured, something
after the middle of that afternoon, in his best
attire, up into Claude&rsquo;s workroom? He came to
apologize. But Claude was not there.</p>

<p>He waited, but the young man did not return. The
air was hot and still. Mr. Tarbox looked at his watch&mdash;it
was a quarter of five. He rose and descended
to the street, looked up and down it, and then moved
briskly down to, and across, Canal Street and into
Bourbon. He had an appointment.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
Claude had not gone back to his loft at all. He
was wandering up and down the streets. About four
he was in Bienville Street, where the pleasure-trains
run through it on their way out to Spanish Fort, a
beautiful pleasure-ground some six miles away from
the city&rsquo;s centre, on the margin of Lake Pontchartrain.
He was listlessly crossing the way as a train came
along, and it was easy for the habit of the aforetime
brakeman to move him. As the last platform passed
the crossing, he reached out mechanically and swung
aboard.</p>

<p>Spanish Fort is at the mouth of Bayou St. John.
A draw-bridge spans the bayou. On the farther, the
eastern, side, Claude stood leaning against a pile, looking
off far beyond West End to where the sun was
setting in the swamps about Lake Maurepas. There&mdash;there&mdash;not
seen save by memory&rsquo;s eye, yet there
not the less, was Bayou des Acadiens. Ah me! there
was Grande Pointe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O Bonaventure! Do I owe you&rdquo;&mdash;Claude&rsquo;s
thought was in the old Acadian tongue&mdash;&ldquo;Do I owe
you malice for this? No, no, no! Better <em>this</em> than
<em>less</em>.&rdquo; And then he recalled a writing-book copy that
Bonaventure had set for him, of the schoolmaster&rsquo;s
own devising: <em>Better Great Sorrow than Small Delight.</em>
His throat tightened and his eyes swam.</p>

<p>A pretty schooner, with green hull and new sails,
came down the bayou. As he turned to gaze on her,
the bridge, just beyond his feet, began to swing open.
He stepped upon it and moved towards its centre, his
eyes still on the beautiful silent advance of the vessel.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
With a number of persons who had gathered from both
ends of the bridge, he paused and leaned over the rail
as the schooner, with her crew looking up into the
faces of the throng, glided close by. A female form
came beside him, looking down with the rest and shedding
upon the air the soft sweetness of perfumed
robes. A masculine voice, just beyond, said:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;A thing of beauty is a joy forever.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Claude started and looked up, and behold, Marguerite
on the arm of Tarbox!</p>

<p>His movement drew their glance, and the next instant
Mr. Tarbox, beaming apology and pouring out
glad greetings, had him by the hand. Burning, choking,
stammering, Claude heard and answered, he knew
not how, the voice of the queen of all her kind.
Another pair pressed forward to add their salutations.
They were Zos&eacute;phine and the surveyor.</p>

<p>Because the facilities for entertaining a male visitor
were slender at the Women&rsquo;s Exchange, because
there was hope of more and cooler air at the lake-side,
because Spanish Fort was a pretty and romantic spot
and not so apt to be thronged as West End, and because
Marguerite, as she described it, was tired of
houses and streets, and also because he had something
to say to Zos&eacute;phine, Mr. Tarbox had brought the
pretty mother and daughter out here. The engineer
had met the three by chance only a few minutes before,
and now as the bridge closed again he passed
Zos&eacute;phine over to Claude, walked only a little way
with them down a path among the shrubbery, and then
lifted his hat and withdrew.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
For once in his life Mr. G. W. Tarbox, as he walked
with Marguerite in advance of Claude and her mother,
was at a loss what to say. The drollness of the situation
was in danger of overcoming him again. Behind
him was Claude, his mind tossed on a wild sea of
doubts and suspicions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told him,&rdquo; thought Tarbox, while the girl on his
arm talked on in pretty, broken English and sprightly
haste about something he had lost the drift of&mdash;&ldquo;I
told him I was courting Josephine. But I never
proved it to him. And now just look at this! Look
at the whole sweet mess! Something has got to be
done.&rdquo; He did not mean something direct and openhanded;
that would never have occurred to him. He
stopped, and with Marguerite faced the other pair.
One glance into Claude&rsquo;s face, darkened with perplexity,
anger, and a distressful effort to look amiable and
comfortable, was one too many; Tarbox burst into a
laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pardon!&rdquo; he exclaimed, checking himself until he
was red; &ldquo;I just happened to think of something very
funny that happened last week in Arkansas&mdash;Madame
Beausoleil, I know it must look odd,&rdquo;&mdash;his voice still
trembled a little, but he kept a sober face&mdash;&ldquo;and
yet I must take just a moment for business. Claude,
can I see you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They went a step aside. Mr. Tarbox put on a
business frown, and said to Claude in a low voice,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hi! diddle, diddle, the cat and the fiddle, the
cow jumped over the moon the little dog laughed to
see the sport and the dish ran away with the spoon
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
you understand I&rsquo;m simply talking for talk&rsquo;s sake as
we resume our walk we&rsquo;ll inadvertently change partners&mdash;a
kind of Women&rsquo;s Exchange as it were
old Mother Hubbard she went to the cupboard to get
her poor dog a bone but when she got there the cupboard&mdash;don&rsquo;t
smile so broadly&mdash;was bare and so the
poor dog had none will that be satisfactory?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Claude nodded, and as they turned again to their
companions the exchange was made with the grace,
silence, and calm unconsciousness of pure oversight,&mdash;or
of general complicity. Very soon it suited Zos&eacute;phine
and Tarbox to sit down upon a little bench
beside a bed of heart&rsquo;s-ease and listen to the orchestra.
But Marguerite preferred to walk in and out among
the leafy shadows of the electric lamps.</p>

<p>And so, side by side, as he had once seen Bonaventure
and Sidonie go, they went, Claude and Marguerite,
away from all windings of disappointment, all shadows
of doubt, all shoals of misapprehension, out upon the
open sea of mutual love. Not that the great word of
words&mdash;affirmative or interrogative&mdash;was spoken then
or there. They came no nearer to it than this,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; murmured Claude,&mdash;they had gone over
all the delicious &ldquo;And-I-thought-that-you&rsquo;s&rdquo; and the
sweetly reproachful &ldquo;Did-you-think-that-I&rsquo;s,&rdquo; and had
covered the past down to the meeting on the bridge,&mdash;&ldquo;I
wish,&rdquo; he murmured, dropping into the old
Acadian French, which he had never spoken to her
before,&mdash;&ldquo;I wish&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; she replied, softly and in the same
tongue.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
&ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; he responded, &ldquo;that this path might
never end.&rdquo; He wondered at his courage, and feared
that now he had ruined all; for she made no answer.
But when he looked down upon her she looked up and
smiled. A little farther on she dropped her fan. He
stooped and picked it up, and, in restoring it, somehow
their hands touched,&mdash;touched and lingered; and then&mdash;and
then&mdash;through one brief unspeakable moment,
a maiden&rsquo;s hand, for the first time in his life, lay willingly
in his. Then, as glad as she was frightened,
Marguerite said she must go back to her mother, and
they went.</p>

<h3><a name="PART_III_CHAP_XXII" id="PART_III_CHAP_XXII"></a>CHAPTER XXII.</h3>

<h3>A DOUBLE LOVE-KNOT.</h3>


<p>Spanish Fort&mdash;West End&mdash;they are well enough;
but if I might have one small part of New Orleans to
take with me wherever I may wander in this earthly
pilgrimage, I should ask for the old Carrollton Gardens.</p>

<p>They lie near the farthest upper limit of the expanded
city. I should want, of course, to include the
levee, under which runs one side of the gardens&rsquo; fence;
also the opposite shore of the Mississippi, with its just
discernible plantation houses behind their levee; and
the great bend of the river itself, with the sun setting
in unutterable gorgeousness behind the distant, low-lying
pecan groves of Nine-mile Point, and the bronzed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
and purpled waters kissing the very crown of the great
turfed levee, down under whose land side the gardens
blossom and give forth their hundred perfumes and
bird songs to the children and lovers that haunt their
winding alleys of oleander, jasmine, laurestine, orange,
aloe, and rose, the grove of magnolias and oaks, and
come out upon the levee&rsquo;s top as the sun sinks, to
catch the gentle breeze and see the twilight change
to moonlight on the water.</p>

<p>One evening as I sat on one of the levee benches
here, with one whose I am and who is mine beside me,
we noticed on the water opposite us, and near the
farther shore, a large skiff propelled with two pairs
of oars and containing, besides the two rowers, half a
dozen passengers.</p>

<p>Then I remembered that I had seen the same craft
when it was farther down the stream. The river is of
a typical character about here. Coming around the
upper bend, the vast current sweeps across to this, the
Carrollton side, and strikes it just above the gardens
with an incalculable gnawing, tearing power. Hence
the very high levee here; the farther back the levee
builders are driven by the corroding waters the lower
the ground is under them, and the higher they must
build to reach the height they reached before. From
Carrollton the current rebounds, and swinging over to
the other shore strikes it, boiling like a witch&rsquo;s caldron,
just above and along the place where you may
descry the levee lock of the Company Canal.</p>

<p>I knew the waters all about there, and knew that
this skiff full of passengers, some of whom we could
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
see were women, having toiled through the seething
current below, was now in a broad eddy, and, if it
was about to cross the stream, would do so only after
it had gone some hundred yards farther up the river.
There it could cross almost with the current.</p>

<p>And so it did. I had forgotten it again, when presently
it showed itself with all its freight, silhouetted
against the crimson sky. I said quickly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe Bonaventure Deschamps is in that boat!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was right. The skiff landed, and we saw its passengers
step ashore. They came along the levee&rsquo;s
crown towards us, &ldquo;by two, by two.&rdquo; Bonaventure
was mated with a young Methodist preacher, who had
been my playmate in boyhood, and who lived here in
Carrollton. Behind him came St. Pierre and Sidonie.
Then followed Claude and Marguerite; and, behind
all, Zos&eacute;phine and Tarbox.</p>

<p>They had come, they explained to us, from a funeral
at the head of the canal. They did not say the funeral
of a friend, and yet I could see that every one of
them, even the preacher, had shed tears. The others
had thought it best and pleasantest to accompany the
minister thus far towards his home, then take a turn in
the gardens, and then take the horse-cars for the city&rsquo;s
centre. Bonaventure and Sidonie were to return next
day by steamer to Belle Alliance and Grande Pointe.
The thoughtful Tarbox had procured Bonaventure&rsquo;s
presence at the inquest of the day before as the identifying
witness, thus to save Zos&eacute;phine that painful
office. And yet it was of Zos&eacute;phine&rsquo;s own motion,
and by her sad insistence, that she and her daughter
followed the outcast to his grave.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she had said, laying one hand in Bonaventure&rsquo;s
and the other in Sidonie&rsquo;s and speaking in the
old Acadian tongue, &ldquo;when I was young and proud I
taught &rsquo;Thanase to despise and tease him. I did not
know then that I was such a coward myself. If I had
been a better scholar, Bonaventure, when we used to
go to school to the cur&eacute; together&mdash;a better learner&mdash;not
in the books merely, but in those things that are so
much better than the things books teach&mdash;how different
all might have been! Thank God, Bonaventure, one of
us was.&rdquo; She turned to Sidonie to add,&mdash;&ldquo;But that
one was Bonaventure. We will all go&rdquo;&mdash;to the
funeral&mdash;&ldquo;we will all go and bury vain regrets&mdash;with
the dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The influence of the sad office they had just performed
was on the group still, as they paused to give
us the words of greeting we coveted. Yet we could see
that a certain sense of being very, very rich in happiness
was on them all, though differently on every one.</p>

<p>Zos&eacute;phine wore the pear-shaped pearl.</p>

<p>The preacher said good-day, and started down the
steps that used to lead from the levee down across
a pretty fountained court and into the town. But my
friend Tarbox&mdash;for I must tell you I like to call him
my friend, and like it better every day; we can&rsquo;t all
be one sort; you&rsquo;d like him if you knew him as I do&mdash;my
friend Tarbox beckoned me to detain him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Christian!&rdquo; I called&mdash;that is the preacher&rsquo;s real
name. He turned back and met Tarbox just where
I stood. They laid their arms across each other&rsquo;s
shoulders in a very Methodist way, and I heard Tarbox
say:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
&ldquo;I want to thank you once more. We&rsquo;ve put you
to a good deal of trouble. You gave us the best
you had: I&rsquo;ll never forget what you said about &lsquo;them
who through fear of death are all their life-time subject
to bondage.&rsquo; I wish you were a Catholic priest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So we could pay you for your trouble. I don&rsquo;t
think you ought to take it hard if you get a check in
to-morrow&rsquo;s mail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thy money survive with thee,&rdquo; said the preacher.
&ldquo;Is that all you want me to be a priest for? Isn&rsquo;t
there another reason?&rdquo; His eyes twinkled. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t
there something else I could do for you&mdash;you or
Claude&mdash;if I should turn priest?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Tarbox, with grave lips, but merry
eyes; &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve both got to have one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In fact they had two. Yet I have it from her husband
himself, that Madame Tarbox insists to this day,
always with the same sweet dignity, that she never did
say yes.</p>

<p>On the other hand, when Claude and Marguerite
were kneeling at the altar the proud St. Pierre, senior,
spoke an audible and joyously impatient affirmative
every time either of them was asked a question. When
the time came for kissing, Sidonie, turning from both
brides, kissed St. Pierre the more for that she kissed
not Claude, then turned again and gave a tear with
the kiss she gave to Zos&eacute;phine. But the deepest, gladdest
tears at those nuptials were shed by Bonaventure
Deschamps.</p>
